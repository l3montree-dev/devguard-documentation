# Instructions for Draft generation

When you receive this filled questionnaire, use it with the concept-explanation-template.mdx to:
1. Generate a comprehensive, understanding-oriented explanation following the Diataxis framework
2. Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than step-by-step instructions
3. Use clear, conceptual language that builds understanding
4. Include diagrams (mermaid syntax) to visualize concepts
5. Start with the problem, then explain the solution
6. Provide real-world analogies where helpful
7. Explain design decisions and trade-offs
8. Use callouts to highlight key insights
9. Link to related concepts throughout
10. Avoid imperative language - focus on explanation, not instruction
11. Include comparisons with alternatives where relevant
12. Address common misconceptions explicitly


## Universal Quality Standards

### Immediate Usability
- [ ] **Can users copy-paste code and run it immediately?** (Stripe pattern)
  - No placeholder variables like `YOUR_API_KEY` in main examples
  - Actual runnable commands provided
  - Environment-specific instructions included (Mac/Linux/Windows if relevant)

- [ ] **Is there a "quick win" in the first 5 minutes?** (Kubernetes pattern)
  - Users see results fast
  - First success happens early
  - Complex details deferred to later sections

- [ ] **Are there multiple entry points for different skill levels?** (Stripe pattern)
  - Quick start for experienced users
  - Detailed walkthrough for beginners
  - Clear navigation between both

### Code Examples

- [ ] **Do code examples show the COMPLETE context?** (GitHub API pattern)
  - Full curl commands with all headers
  - Complete request bodies (not just fragments)
  - Full response examples (not just schema)

- [ ] **Are examples provided in multiple formats?** (GitHub API pattern)
  - curl / CLI
  - Code library (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
  - UI screenshots where applicable

- [ ] **Do examples use realistic data?** (Avoid "foo", "bar", "test123")
  - Real-world naming conventions
  - Meaningful example values
  - Context that matches actual use cases

### Progressive Disclosure

- [ ] **Is there a clear "what happens next" explanation?** (Stripe pattern)
  - After each code block, explain what the system does
  - Show the flow: "When you run this command, the following happens: 1... 2... 3..."
  - Make the invisible visible

- [ ] **Do you show the "complete picture" before diving into details?** (Docker pattern)
  - Architecture diagram early
  - Overall flow explained first
  - Then drill into specifics

- [ ] **Are advanced/optional topics clearly marked and separated?** (Stripe pattern)
  - Optional sections labeled as such
  - Advanced content doesn't interrupt basic flow
  - Easy to skip and come back later

## Concept/explanations Quality

### Understanding First
- [ ] **Do you explain the PROBLEM before the solution?** (Docker pattern)
  - Why does this exist?
  - What problem does it solve?
  - What would happen without it?

- [ ] **Are there diagrams for complex concepts?** (Docker architecture diagram)
  - Visual representation of architecture
  - Flow diagrams for processes
  - Not just walls of text

- [ ] **Do you use concrete analogies or metaphors?** (Docker "container" analogy)
  - Relate to familiar concepts
  - Make abstract concrete
  - Avoid jargon-only explanations

### Design Decisions
- [ ] **Do you explain WHY things are designed this way?** (Docker pattern)
  - Trade-offs discussed
  - Alternative approaches mentioned
  - Design rationale transparent
