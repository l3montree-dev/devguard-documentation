# GitHub Integration

DevGuard integrates with GitHub through a **GitHub App**, providing secure access to your repositories for issue management.

## Overview

The GitHub integration provides:

- **Repository Access**: List and import repositories from GitHub organizations
- **Issue Management**: Create and update GitHub Issues for discovered vulnerabilities
- **Webhook Processing**: React to issue changes and comments in real-time
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated scanning via GitHub Actions

<Callout type="info">
  The GitHub App enables secure repository access and manages webhooks for issue tracking. Vulnerability scanning is authenticated separately using a DevGuard Token (Personal Access Token, PAT).
</Callout> 



## How It Works

1. **Configure Integration**: Add the DevGuard GitHub App to your GitHub organization
2. **Link Asset**: Connect a DevGuard asset to a GitHub repository
3. **Create Issues**: Vulnerabilities can be pushed to GitHub Issues for tracking (automatically or manually)
4. **Sync Status**: Changes in either system are synchronized via webhooks


## Issue Creation

When a vulnerability is flagged for remediation, DevGuard creates a GitHub issue containing detailed information about the vulnerability, including severity, affected components, and labels for categorization.

## Comment Commands

Users can control vulnerability status through issue comments:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/accept <reason>` | Accept the vulnerability risk |
| `/component-not-present  <reason>` | Mark as false positive |
| `/vulnerable-code-not-present <reason>` | Mark as false positive | 
| `/vulnerable-code-not-in-execute-path  <reason>` | Mark as false positive | 
| `/vulnerable-code-cannot-be-controlled-by-adversary  <reason>` | Mark as false positive | 
| `/inline-mitigations-already-exist  <reason>` | Mark as false positive |  
| `/reopen` | Reopen a closed vulnerability |

<Callout type="info">
  Only repository collaborators can use these commands. DevGuard verifies permissions before processing.
</Callout>



### Processed Events

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Issue Closed | Vulnerability marked as accepted |
| Issue Reopened | Vulnerability reopened |
| Issue Deleted | Vulnerability marked as false positive |
| Comment Added | Process slash commands |

## Issue State Synchronization

| GitHub Action | DevGuard Interpretation |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Close issue | Vulnerability accepted |
| Reopen issue | Vulnerability reopened |
| Delete issue | Vulnerability false positive |
