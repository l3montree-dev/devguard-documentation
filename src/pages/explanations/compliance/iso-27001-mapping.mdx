# ISO 27001 Controls - Annex A

## What is ISO 27001?

ISO 27001 is an international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It provides organizations with a systematic approach to protect sensitive information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

The current version ISO 27001:2022 was published in October 2022 and replaces the 2013 version. The standard consists of two main parts:

- **Clauses 4-10**: Define the requirements for the ISMS itself—the "what" (context, leadership, planning, operations, etc.)
- **Annex A**: Lists 93 specific security controls—the "how"

## What is Annex A?

Annex A is a catalog of security controls from which organizations can select the measures relevant to them. Unlike Clauses 4-10, which are mandatory for all, the Annex A controls are selected based on a risk assessment.

The 93 controls in ISO 27001:2022 are divided into four categories:

1. **Organizational Controls (A.5)**: 37 controls for policies, roles, risk management
2. **People Controls (A.6)**: 8 controls for employees, training, responsibilities
3. **Physical Controls (A.7)**: 14 controls for physical security, access controls
4. **Technological Controls (A.8)**: 34 controls for technical security measures

### Statement of Applicability (SoA)

The Statement of Applicability is a central document in every ISMS. It documents:

- Which Annex A controls the organization implements
- Why these controls were selected
- Which controls are deliberately excluded and the justification for this
- The current implementation status

The SoA is reviewed by auditors and must be updated when changes occur. It is the connection between the risk assessment and the concrete security measures.

## Focus: A.8 Technological Controls

DevGuard focuses on the technological controls from Annex A.8, as these directly affect software development and the operation of applications. These controls address topics such as:

- Access control to source code
- Management of technical vulnerabilities
- Secure software development (Secure Development Lifecycle)
- Security testing during development
- Protection against malware

For development teams, these controls are particularly relevant as they impact daily work with code, dependencies, and deployment processes.

| [A.8.26 Application security requirements ](#a826-application-security-requirements) | 🔵 | The measure requires that information security requirements are identified, specified and approved during the development or procurement of applications to ensure their consideration throughout the process.|
| [A.8.28 Secure Coding ](#a828-secure-coding)                       | ✅  | The measure requires the application of the principles of secure coding in software development to ensure the security of the software and minimize potential security vulnerabilities.|
| [A.8.29 Security Testing in Development and Acceptance](#a829-security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance) | ✅  | The measure requires the definition and integration of security testing procedures into the development lifecycle to ensure that information security requirements are met when applications or code are deployed in the production environment.|
| [A.8.30 Outsourced Development](#a830-outsourced-development)      |  🔵  | The measure requires the organization to manage, monitor and review the activities of outsourced system development to ensure that the required information security measures are implemented.|
