# Overview

The DevGuard CI/CD components implement the OWASP DevSecOps pipeline in an optimal way,
eliminating the need for extensive cybersecurity expertise. You can integrate the
DevGuard CI/CD pipeline with your repository on GitHub or GitLab.

Once integrated, the DevGuard CI/CD pipeline will scan your codebase, identify vulnerabilities,
and provide attestation and evidence for completed checks.

On DevGuard, you can manage, prioritize, and resolve vulnerabilities, achieve compliance, and
access additional features.

Let's get your release pre-flight checks done with DevGuard ✅ 🚀

## Architecture Overview

![](../../assets/architecture-overview.png)

### DevGuard CI/CD Integration

Learn more about the DevSecOps pipeline steps and how they work together
in the [DevSecOps](/concepts/devsecops/understanding-owasp-devsecops-pipeline) section.

The pipeline steps are based on the OWASP DevSecOps pipeline, mixed with the concept to
gather evidence and attestation for actions performed in the pipeline.
The checks will report via SBOM or SARIF-report vulnerabilities to DevGuard. DevGuard
will help you manage, prioritize, and resolve found vulnerabilities.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to [setup GitHub integration](/getting-started/setup-github-integration)
or [setup GitLab integration](/getting-started/setup-gitlab-integration).

### Aggregated Vulnerability Database

DevGuard continuously monitors your project against known vulnerabilities.

To provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information, and 
to help you prioritize your remediation efforts, we aggregate data from
multiple vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD, EPSS, OSV, Exploit DB, GitHub PoCs, etc.).

Learn more about the [aggregated vulnerability database](/concepts/aggregated-vulnerability-database)
and how it works.

### Vulnerability Management & Issue Synchronization

DevGuard provides a centralized view of all vulnerabilities in your codebase, allowing you to
prioritize and manage them effectively. Based on the aggregated vulnerability database,
you can see the risk level of each vulnerability and prioritize them accordingly.

You can also synchronize issues with external issue trackers, such as GitHub Issues
or GitLab Issues (more like Jira in the future). From the issues there, you
can also handle the vulnerability management process via slash commands.

### Attestation-Based Compliance

A core part of software supply chain security is the ability to securely
link the steps in the software supply chain to the final product, provide
evidence of the steps taken, and ensure that the final product is
built and deployed securely.

DevGuard records the evidence and provides attestation for each step in the
DevSecOps pipeline. This allows you to prove that necessary security checks
were performed and that the final product is secure. As an attestation is
actually a signed statement and DevGuard collects more evidence than just
the checks, you can use DevGuard to prove a lot of typical compliance
requirements (e.g. from ISO27001, PCI-DSS, etc.).

Learn more in the [Attestation & Provenance](/concepts/attestations-provenance)
section.

## Which Data from Your Codebase is Stored?

When DevGuard is integrated with a repository, it
performs software composition analysis (SCA) and container scanning
on the codebase. It uses Trivy to scan the application’s dependencies and container
images in the repository. A Software Bill of Materials
(SBOM) is then generated.

The Trivy scan is executed via CLI commands, typically
in a CI/CD pipeline where the repository is hosted, such
as GitHub, GitLab, or a private GitLab instance.

The results of the scan, including the SBOM, are sent to
the DevGuard API using a personal access token
generated by the user on DevGuard. This token is
securely stored in the repository’s secrets, ensuring
that only the repository with the correct token can
transmit data to DevGuard. For more information about
what and how DevGuard analyzes the SBOM, refer to the
SBOM Analysis.

The transfer of data from the repository to DevGuard is
conducted through the HTTPS protocol, ensuring secure
and encrypted communication.

The transmitted SBOM is analyzed to find vulnerabilities
in the codebase by comparing it with DevGuard's
vulnerability databases, which are derived from public
sources. DevGuard calculates a risk score based on the
founded vulnerabilities and its optimized algorithms.

Access to data stored in DevGuard is restricted to users
with the appropriate permissions.

## What is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)?
           
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed inventory of
all components, dependencies, and libraries within a software application,
including their versions, origins, and relationships. Think of it as an
ingredient list for software, providing transparency into the third-party
and open-source elements used during development. The SBOM doesn't contain
the source code itself but rather metadata about the components.
