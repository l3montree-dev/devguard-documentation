# Open Standards First

DevGuard exclusively uses open, vendor-neutral standards for data exchange and analysis. No proprietary protocols, no vendor lock-in—only industry-standard formats ensuring maximum compatibility across your security toolchain.

## Why Open Standards

**Vendor Independence**: Switch tools without data migration. Your vulnerability data remains accessible regardless of scanners or platforms.

**Ecosystem Compatibility**: Integrate any tool supporting standard formats—no custom adapters required.

**Future-Proof**: Standards evolve through community consensus, not vendor roadmaps.

**Transparency**: Publicly documented and auditable specifications.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔓">
  DevGuard's commitment to open standards means you're never locked in—export data, switch platforms, or integrate new tools without proprietary barriers.
</Callout>

## The Three Core Standards

### SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

Comprehensive inventory of software components, dependencies, and versions.

**Formats**: CycloneDX (JSON/XML), SPDX (JSON/YAML) <span className="text-sm text-gray-500">Coming Soon</span>

**Use Cases**: Supply chain transparency, vulnerability tracking, license compliance, dependency analysis.

**DevGuard**: Generate automatically, import from external tools, export for downstream consumers.

### VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)

Machine-readable assessments communicating which vulnerabilities affect your products and which don't, with justifications.

**Formats**: CycloneDX VEX (JSON/XML), CSAF VEX (JSON)

**Use Cases**: Reduce false positives, communicate actual exploitability, eliminate redundant analysis.

**DevGuard**: Document Not Affected assessments, publish VEX endpoints, consume supplier VEX.

### SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)

Standardized format for static analysis findings including <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className="underline decoration-dotted decoration-yellow-400 decoration-1 underline-offset-4 cursor-pointer">SAST</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent><p>Static Application Security Testing - Code vulnerability analysis</p></TooltipContent></Tooltip>, secret scanning, and code quality issues.

**Format**: JSON

**Use Cases**: Integrate diverse analysis tools into unified workflow without tool-specific parsers.

**DevGuard**: Ingest from any SARIF-compliant tool, combine with SBOM data for unified risk view.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔄">
  All three standards supported by major vendors, mandated by regulations (CRA, NTIA), and endorsed by standards bodies (OWASP, CISA).
</Callout>

## No Proprietary Protocols

**No Vendor Lock-In**: Export data in standard formats anytime. Switch platforms without migration projects.

**No Format Conversion**: Tools output standards, DevGuard consumes standards. No custom converters.

**No Closed Specifications**: Every format publicly documented with open specifications.

## Practical Benefits

**Tool Flexibility**: Use any scanner—Trivy, Grype, Semgrep, CodeQL—all output standards. Switch tools without DevGuard changes.

**Supply Chain Integration**: Share data across organizations using formats everyone understands. Import supplier assessments, export yours.

**Regulatory Compliance**: CRA requires SBOMs, NTIA specifies formats, executive orders reference standards. Using standards positions you for current and future requirements.
