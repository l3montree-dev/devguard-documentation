# Risk Scoring

DevGuard calculates risk scores for every vulnerability using a multi-dimensional formula that goes beyond simple <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className="underline decoration-dotted decoration-yellow-400 decoration-1 underline-offset-4 cursor-pointer">CVSS</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent><p>Common Vulnerability Scoring System - Technical severity rating</p></TooltipContent></Tooltip> severity ratings. This enables accurate prioritization based on actual threat to your applications, not just theoretical vulnerability severity.

## Why Risk Scoring Matters

Not all "High" severity vulnerabilities pose equal risk. A critical <Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className="underline decoration-dotted decoration-yellow-400 decoration-1 underline-offset-4 cursor-pointer">CVE</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent><p>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - Standardized vulnerability identifier</p></TooltipContent></Tooltip> in a deep transitive dependency with no known exploits presents far less danger than a moderate severity vulnerability in a direct dependency actively exploited in the wild. DevGuard's risk scoring combines multiple factors to answer: *Which vulnerabilities actually threaten your applications?*

## The Risk Formula

DevGuard uses a comprehensive formula balancing four critical dimensions:
```
Risk = ((CVSS-BE × (EPSS + 1)) / 2) / Component Depth
```

**CVSS-BE**: Technical severity adjusted for your organizational context (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability requirements)

**EPSS**: Exploit Prediction Scoring—probability the vulnerability will be exploited within 30 days based on threat intelligence

**Component Depth**: Position in your dependency tree—deeper dependencies are less exploitable than direct ones

<Callout type="info" emoji="📊">
  This formula ensures high-risk scores reflect genuine threats combining technical severity, exploit probability, organizational impact, and attack surface—not just CVSS numbers.
</Callout>

## Example Comparison

**Vulnerability A**:
- CVSS: 9.8 (Critical)
- EPSS: 0.5% (very low exploitation probability)
- Depth: 5 (deep transitive dependency)
- **DevGuard Risk**: 2.1 (Low-Medium)

**Vulnerability B**:
- CVSS: 7.5 (High)
- EPSS: 78% (actively exploited)
- Depth: 1 (direct dependency)
- **DevGuard Risk**: 6.7 (High)

Despite lower CVSS, Vulnerability B receives higher priority—it's actively exploited and directly reachable in your codebase.

## Dynamic Risk Updates

Risk scores recalculate multiple times daily as threat intelligence evolves:

**New exploits published**: EPSS increases, risk score rises  
**Patches released**: Risk urgency changes  
**Dependency updates**: Component depth shifts  
**Security requirements changed**: Environmental context adjusts scores

DevGuard automatically notifies you when risk scores change significantly, ensuring priorities stay current with the threat landscape.
