# Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

## What is Software Composition Analysis?

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) identifies and assesses open-source and third-party dependencies in your software. By analyzing dependency manifests and runtime libraries, SCA detects known vulnerabilities. This process is crucial for managing risks associated with using open-source software.

## How DevGuard SCA Works

1.	SBOM Generation: DevGuard uses [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) to scan the application’s dependencies and generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). The SBOM contains all detected components and their metadata.
2.	Vulnerability Matching:
    The SBOM is cross-referenced with:
    - Public vulnerability databases like CVE.
    - DevGuard’s extended database for enhanced coverage.
3.	Risk Reporting: Tickets are automatically created for detected vulnerabilities if integrations (e.g., GitLab Issues, GitHub Issues) are enabled. Otherwise, the risks are visible in:
    - DevGuard UI: A dashboard showing the current risk posture.
    - Command Output: Run `devguard-scanner sca` to view detected vulnerabilities.

## Why SCA Matters

- Security: Protect against exploits by addressing known vulnerabilities.
- Compliance: Ensure alignment with compliance and security framework requirements.
- Reliability: Minimize runtime failures due to outdated or insecure dependencies.

By incorporating SCA into your development lifecycle, you can proactively manage risks and contribute to a secure software supply chain.
