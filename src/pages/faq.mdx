                        The Trivy scan is executed via CLI commands, typically
                        in a CI/CD pipeline where the repository is hosted, such
                        as GitHub, GitLab, or a private GitLab instance.

                        securely stored in the repository’s secrets, ensuring
                        that only the repository with the correct token can
                        transmit data to DevGuard. For more information about

                        The transmitted SBOM is analyzed to find vulnerabilities

                        vulnerability databases, which are derived from public
                        sources. DevGuard calculates a risk score based on the

            question: 'What is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)?',
            answer: 
            <p className="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-300">
             Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed inventory of
             all components, dependencies, and libraries within a software application,
             including their versions, origins, and relationships. Think of it as an
             ingredient list for software, providing transparency into the third-party
             and open-source elements used during development. The SBOM doesn't contain
             the source code itself but rather metadata about the components.
