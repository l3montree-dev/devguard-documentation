## Secret Scanning Workflow


 The `secret-scanning` workflow is designed to identify sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets within your codebase. By integrating secret scanning into your CI/CD pipeline, developers can proactively prevent the accidental exposure of confidential data, enhancing the overall security posture of the application.



 The `secret-scanning` accept a following inputs:
| Name                   | Description                                                                   | Required    | Default Value                                    | 
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----|----------------------------------|
| `api-url`               | URL of the DevGuard API                                                       | No          | `https://api.main.devguard.org`                 |  
| `asset-name`            | Name of the asset to be scanned                                               | Yes         |                                                 |           
| `path`              | Path to the source code to be scanned                                         | No          | `.`                                              | 


Usage Example:
Hereâ€™s an example of how to call this reusable workflow from another workflow file:
```yaml copy
name: DevGuard Workflow

on:
    push

jobs:
    devguard-secret-scanning:
        uses: l3montree-dev/devguard-action/.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml@main
        with:
          api-url: https://api.main.devguard.org
          asset-name: 'myOrgnaization/projects/myProject/assets/myAsset'
        secrets:
          devguard-token: ${{ secrets.DEVGUARD_TOKEN }}
```
