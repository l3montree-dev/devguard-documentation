The `container-scanning` accepts the following inputs:
| Name                   | Description                                                                   | Required    | Default Value                                    |

| `api-url`               | URL of the DevGuard API                                                       | No          | `https://api.main.devguard.org`                 |  
| `asset-name`            | Name of the asset to be scanned                                               | Yes         |                                                 |           
| `path`              | Path to the source code to be scanned                                         | No          | `.`                                              | 
| `image-path`| Path to the OCI image to be scanned. Only necessary if the reusable workflow is not used for further processing of the built image.tar | No          | `image.tar`                                      | 
| `artifact-suffix`                 |   This is only needed if you are using this job multiple times in the same workflow.

| `fetch-image-from-registry`               |      If set to true, the image will be pulled from the registry instead of using the artifact.   | No          | `false`                                              | 

Usage Example:
Hereâ€™s an example of how to call this reusable workflow from another workflow file:
```yaml copy
name: DevGuard Workflow

on:
    push

jobs:
    devguard-container-scanning:
        uses: l3montree-dev/devguard-action/.github/workflows/container-scanning.yml@main
        with:
          api-url: https://api.main.devguard.org
          asset-name: 'myOrgnaization/projects/myProject/assets/myAsset'
        secrets:
          devguard-token: ${{ secrets.DEVGUARD_TOKEN }}
```
