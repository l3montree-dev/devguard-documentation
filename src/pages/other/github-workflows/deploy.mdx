| `asset-name`            | Name of the asset to be scanned                                               | Yes         |                                                 |

Usage Example:
Hereâ€™s an example of how to call this reusable workflow from another workflow file:
```yaml copy
name: DevGuard Workflow

on:
    push

jobs:
    devguard-deploy:
        uses: l3montree-dev/devguard-action/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
        with:
          api-url: https://api.main.devguard.org
          asset-name: 'myOrgnaization/projects/myProject/assets/myAsset'
        secrets:
          devguard-token: ${{ secrets.DEVGUARD_TOKEN }}
```
