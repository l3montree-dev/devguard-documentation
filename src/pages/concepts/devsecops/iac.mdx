## What is Infrastructure as Code Scanning (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning is a practice that involves static code analysis to identify security and configuration issues in infrastructure code. IaC scanning tools examine the code used to provision and manage infrastructure, detecting potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and best practice violations before the code is deployed. This process ensures that your infrastructure is secure, compliant, and optimized for performance.


## Why IaC Scanning Matters

- **Prevents Security Vulnerabilities**: Identifies security vulnerabilities early in the development process, helping to avoid potential breaches or data leaks.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Helps organizations adhere to industry regulations and internal security policies by catching misconfigurations or violations of best practices.
- **Reduces Downtime**: By detecting and addressing issues in the code before deployment, IaC scanning reduces the likelihood of infrastructure failures or outages.
- **Improves Code Quality**: Encourages best practices in writing infrastructure code, leading to more efficient, reliable, and maintainable infrastructure setups.
- **Automates Security Checks**: Automates the process of checking infrastructure code for security issues, making it easier to maintain secure environments at scale.
