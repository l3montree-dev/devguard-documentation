# DevGuard Vulnerability Database: 

DevGuard imports data from multiple sources to construct a robust and comprehensive database of vulnerabilities. The database is refreshed every six hours, ensuring that data is up-to-date. This page provides an overview of the primary sources that contribute to the DevGuard vulnerability database. You can access this vulnerability data on the [L3montree website](https://l3montree.com/schwachstellen-datenbank).

## Primary Sources

1. **GitHub Exploits**  
   DevGuard integrates exploit data shared publicly on GitHub. This source provides information on real-world exploit implementations, enabling developers to understand the practical impact of vulnerabilities.

2. **EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)**  
   EPSS offers data-driven predictions on the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. This helps prioritize vulnerabilities based on their exploitability.

3. **CVE List (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**  
   The CVE List is a centralized catalog of publicly known security vulnerabilities. DevGuard leverages this to maintain a standardized reference for vulnerabilities.

4. **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**  
   NVD enriches CVE entries with additional metadata such as severity scores (CVSS), impact metrics, and fix information, providing more context for vulnerability assessment.

5. **Exploit DB (Exploit Database)**  
   A curated archive of publicly available exploits, including proof-of-concept code. This serves as a valuable resource for understanding practical exploitation techniques.

6. **OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)**  
   OSV consolidates vulnerability data from various open-source projects, ensuring comprehensive coverage of issues in open-source ecosystems.

## OSV Data Sources

The OSV component aggregates data from multiple specialized databases to cover a wide range of ecosystems:

- **GitHub Advisory Database**: Security advisories published on GitHub.
- **PyPI Advisory Database**: Vulnerabilities in Python packages.
- **Go Vulnerability Database**: Issues in Go libraries and applications.
- **Rust Advisory Database**: Security issues in Rust crates.
- **Global Security Database**: General open-source vulnerabilities.
- **OSS-Fuzz**: Vulnerabilities found via Google's fuzzing project.
- **Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux**: Security advisories from these Linux distributions.
- **Haskell Security Advisories**: Vulnerabilities affecting Haskell libraries.
- **RConsortium Advisory Database**: Security issues in R language packages.
- **OpenSSF Malicious Packages**: Malicious open-source packages detected by the OpenSSF community.
- **Python Software Foundation Database**: Security issues tracked by the Python Software Foundation.
- **Bitnami Vulnerability Database**: Vulnerabilities in Bitnami-packaged applications.
- **Ubuntu**: Security advisories from the Ubuntu ecosystem.
