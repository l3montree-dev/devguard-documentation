# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  DevGuard performs infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning to identify vulnerabilities in your project's infrastructure configurations (e.g. Dockerfile or Helm-Chart) - [Background Information](/concepts/devsecops/iac)
</Callout>

## Handling Found Vulnerabilities: Practical Steps for Mitigation

When DevGuard's **IaC** scanning detects potential security issues, such as the example provided below, it’s crucial to address these findings to prevent vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.

### Steps to Fix

<Steps>

### Analyze and Fix the Code

1. **Review the Finding:** Understand the nature of the issue reported by DevGuard. The tool will provide details about the vulnerability, including the file and line number.

2. **Modify the Code:** Make the necessary changes to the code to fix the identified issue. This may involve refactoring code, or developing security patches.

3. **Test the Changes:** After making modifications, thoroughly test the code to ensure that the issue is resolved and no new vulnerabilities are introduced.

### Alternative Measures

If none of the above fixes are feasible:
- **Risk Acceptance**: Temporarily accept the risk using DevGuard’s risk management feature. Document the accepted risk by providing a justification. Use the UI or slash commands in the issue.
- **Avoidance**: Limit exposure by sandboxing or disabling affected functionality.
