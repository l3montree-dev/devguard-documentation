At DevGuard, we are dedicated to creating a community that is free from harassment and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their background or identity. We expect all members to contribute to an open, welcoming, and respectful environment.

## Key Points
- Respect and Empathy: Treat everyone with kindness and consideration. Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Constructive Feedback: Provide and accept feedback gracefully. Learn from mistakes and focus on community growth.
- Professional Behavior: Avoid inappropriate language, harassment, and any unprofessional conduct.

## Enforcement
Community leaders will enforce these standards and take appropriate action against any unacceptable behavior. This includes removing harmful content and, if necessary, banning individuals who violate the code.

If you experience or witness any misconduct, please report it to community@devguard.org. All reports will be handled promptly and confidentially.
