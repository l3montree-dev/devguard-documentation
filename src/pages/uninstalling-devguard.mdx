# Uninstalling DevGuard

Digital sovereignty is crucial in today's world where control over your own data and software is essential. By maintaining digital sovereignty, you ensure that you have full control over your digital assets and can protect your privacy and security. Thus it is mandatory to have a clear understanding of how to uninstall DevGuard from your system and software development environment that you do not depend on DevGuard as well.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to uninstall DevGuard from your system and gives an overview of alternative tools which are somewhat comparable to DevGuard.

## How to Uninstall

DevGuard consists of multiple components. Precisely, it includes:

- **DevGuard Server Infrastructure**: The api, web frontend, authorization server and database. This component gets either used as Software as a Server, it gets manually installed or deployed in the organization infrastructure using a Helm-Chart.
- **DevGuard CLI**: A Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that is used inside the CI/CD Pipeline to scan the project and verify integrity as well as installed on the developer's machine to scan the project before pushing it to the repository.
- **DevGuard CI/CD Component** or **DevGuard Reusable Workflow**: A reusable workflow (for GitHub users) or a CI/CD component (for GitLab users) that can be used in the CI/CD pipeline. This component utilizes the DevGuard CLI to scan the project and verify integrity.




### Uninstalling the DevGuard Server Infrastructure

Before uninstalling the server infrastructure, make sure to backup the data if you want to keep it for future use. DevGuard stores its data in a PostgreSQL database. You can backup the database using the following command:

```bash
# exec into the pod to dump the database
kubectl exec --namespace <NAMESPACE> -it <POSTGRES POD NAME> -- bash -c "pg_dump -U <POSTGRES USER> <POSTGRES DATABASE> > /tmp/backup.sql"
# copy the backup to your local machine
kubectl cp --namespace <NAMESPACE> <POSTGRES POD NAME>:/tmp/backup.sql /tmp/backup.sql
```

Usually your deployment infrastructure already provides a backup mechanism for the database. Thus you do not need to backup the database manually.


Uninstalling the DevGuard Server Infrastructure is as simple as deleting the Helm-Chart or the manually installed components. If you have deployed the DevGuard Server Infrastructure using a Helm-Chart, you can delete the Helm-Chart using the following command:

```bash
helm delete <RELEASE NAME> --namespace <NAMESPACE>
```


### Uninstalling the DevGuard CLI

The DevGuard CLI is a standalone binary that can be installed on the developer's machine. To uninstall the DevGuard CLI, you can simply delete the binary from your machine. The binary is usually located in the `/usr/local/bin` directory. You can find the path to the binary by running the following command:

```bash
which devguard-scanner
```

Once you have found the path to the binary, you can delete it using the following command:

```bash
rm /usr/local/bin/devguard-scanner
```


### Uninstalling the DevGuard CI/CD Component

The DevGuard CI/CD Component is a reusable workflow (for GitHub users) or a CI/CD component (for GitLab users) that can be used in the CI/CD pipeline. To uninstall the DevGuard CI/CD Component, you can simply delete the workflow or the CI/CD component from your repository.


## Alternatives

### CI/CD Security Scanning Tools

Here is an example reusable workflow which can be used as an alternative to the DevGuard CI/CD Component. The definition makes use of the following tools (which devguard does as well)

|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|
|[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)|Secret scanning|
|[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)|Software composition analysis and container scanning|
|[Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)|Infrastructure as code scanning|
|[Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep)|Static application security testing|
|[Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko)|OCI Build without root privileges|
|[Crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md)|OCI Image Push|
|[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)|Image Signing|
