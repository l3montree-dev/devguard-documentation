# DevGuard

## Mission

DevGuard is built by developers, for developers, aiming to integrate security
seamlessly into the software development lifecycle, ensuring that security
practices are accessible and efficient for everyone, regardless of their
security expertise.

### Contact

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the DevGuard team!

### The problem we solve

Identifying and managing software vulnerabilities is an increasingly critical
challenge. Developers often face security issues without the proper training
or tools that fit into their everyday workflows. DevGuard is a developer-centered
software designed to provide simple, modern solutions for vulnerability detection,
management and technical compliance with common security frameworks.

In 2023 alone, cyberattacks caused approximately 206 billion euros in damage only
in Germany. Many of these attacks exploited software vulnerabilities. With agile
and DevOps methodologies becoming standard, the need for integrating security
into the development process has never been greater. We aim to fill this gap with
DevGuard, offering a seamless integration of vulnerability management into
development workflows.

## Key Features

1. **Developer-Centric Integration:** DevGuard fits naturally into your 
    existing CI/CD workflows, reducing friction and enhancing productivity.
    It supports the OWASP DevSecOps pipeline, offering tools (we just
    reuse open source tools but provide a simplified wrapper cli) for secret
    scanning (coming soon), SAST (coming soon), SCA, container scanning,
    IaC scanning (coming soon) and DAST (coming soon).
2. **Automated Security Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring using Software
    Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to keep your projects secure.
3. **Risk Assessment:** Automatically assesses and prioritizes risks to
    help you address the most critical vulnerabilities first — no really, we do
    this pragmatically and automate where possible! (Our base: CVSS, exploitdb, EPSS)
4. **Compliance:** Ensures your projects meet security standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and PCI-DSS.
5. **Security and confidentiality:** We prioritize the security of this
    software! In an expansion stage and in cooperation with research institutions,
    we want to make confidential data processing usable for the secure handling
    of sensitive information (confidential computing).

## Demo

We are using DevGuard to scan and manage the risks of DevGuard itself—essentially
eating our own dogfood. The project can be found here: 
[Public DevGuard Project](https://main.devguard.org/l3montree-cybersecurity/projects/devguard)

We believe VEX information should be shared via a link due to its dynamic nature,
as what is risk-free today may be affected by a CVE tomorrow. We've integrated
the DevGuard risk scoring into the metrics, with detailed documentation on its
calculation to follow soon. SBOM and VEX data are always up to date at these links:
