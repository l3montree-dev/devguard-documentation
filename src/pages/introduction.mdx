# DevGuard

## Mission

DevGuard is built by developers, for developers, aiming to integrate security
seamlessly into the software development lifecycle, ensuring that security
practices are accessible and efficient for everyone, regardless of their
security expertise.

### The problem we solve

Identifying and managing software vulnerabilities is an increasingly critical
challenge. Developers often face security issues without the proper training
or tools that fit into their everyday workflows. DevGuard is a developer-centered
software designed to provide simple, modern solutions for vulnerability detection,
management and technical compliance with common security frameworks.

In 2023 alone, cyberattacks caused approximately 206 billion euros in damage only
in Germany. Many of these attacks exploited software vulnerabilities. With agile
and DevOps methodologies becoming standard, the need for integrating security
into the development process has never been greater. We aim to fill this gap with
DevGuard, offering a seamless integration of vulnerability management into
development workflows.

## Is DevGuard for you?

    If you're a developer, DevOps engineer, or security-conscious team looking to
    make software security practical, easy, and integrated — DevGuard is built for you.

Here's how DevGuard makes that possible:

- **Risk Management for Developers:** DevGuard provides a comprehensive risk management system that allows developers to assess, prioritize, and manage vulnerabilities effectively. It integrates with your existing workflows, making it easy to track and resolve security issues.

- **Auto Setup for Projects:** One-click default setup for CI pipelines and workflows that:
  - Scan your code for secrets
  - Scan your dependencies (SCA)
  - Build and scan your container images
  - Perform static code analysis (SAST)
  - Check infrastructure-as-code files for misconfigurations (IaC scanning)
  - Check for open source license issues

- **Developer-Centric Integration:** DevGuard fits naturally into your existing CI/CD workflows, reducing friction and enhancing productivity. It supports the OWASP DevSecOps pipeline with simplified CLI wrappers around widely-used open source tools.

- **Integration with Issue Trackers:** Automatically create issues in your preferred issue tracker (like GitHub, GitLab, or Jira) for identified vulnerabilities, making it easy to track and manage security tasks (with slash commands).

- **Bring Your Own Scanner:** Already have SBOMs or use SARIF-format tools? No problem—DevGuard can ingest your data for unified risk visibility.

- **Automated Security Monitoring:** Continuously monitor your projects using SBOMs to ensure you're aware of known vulnerabilities.

- **Risk Assessment That Works:** DevGuard pragmatically assesses and prioritizes vulnerabilities using CVSS, ExploitDB, EPSS, and other sources—automating what can be automated so you can focus on fixing the highest risks first.

- **Compliance-Ready:** Helps you meet requirements for software development of standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and PCI-DSS with minimal effort.

## Demo

We are using DevGuard to scan and manage the risks of DevGuard itself—essentially
eating our own dogfood. The project can be found here: 
[Public DevGuard Project](https://main.devguard.org/l3montree-cybersecurity/projects/devguard)

We believe VEX information should be shared via a link due to its dynamic nature,
as what is risk-free today may be affected by a CVE tomorrow. We've integrated
the DevGuard risk scoring into the metrics, with detailed documentation on its
calculation to follow soon. SBOM and VEX data are always up to date at these links:
