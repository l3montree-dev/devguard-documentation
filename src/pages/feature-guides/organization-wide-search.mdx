# Searching for specific Package in Organization

- It is now possible to search for a specific Package in each Repository in an Organization.
    -   Only Admin & Owner Roles can search for this Package.
    -   This Feature is useful, when you want to quickly check whether a certain Package is used in any Repository (e.g xz-util) and what version it is on.
    -   Additionally it is shown in which artifacts the Package is.
    -   It is found on the organization Page, in the Tabs Area, next to the Settings (you need the correct Permission to see the tab).

# How it works

-   It recursively looks for the specific Package name with an ILIKE statement, in each Repository in your Organization,
     it will only find direct Dependencies (First Party Dependencies).
    -   The search feature is case insensitive.

-   one new endpoint will be available:
    - `api/v1/organizations/{organizationName}/dependency-components?search={packageName}`
    - These endpoints will provide certain information:
        - componentDependencyId
        - dependencyPurl
        - organizationId
        - organizationName
        - projectId
        - projectName
        - projectSlug
        - assetId
        - assetName
        - assetSlug
        - assetVersionName
        - componentPurl
        - componentVersion
        - artifactName
        - artifactAssetVersion
