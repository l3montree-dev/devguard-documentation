# Searching for Specific Packages in Your Organization

## Overview

DevGuard now allows **Admin and Owner roles** to search for specific packages across all repositories within an organization. This feature is designed to help you quickly identify where a particular package (e.g., `xz-util`) is used, including its version and the artifacts it appears in. This is especially useful for security audits, compliance checks, or dependency management.

**Location:** The feature is accessible from the **Organization Page**, in the **Tabs Area**, next to Settings. Only users with the correct permissions will see this tab.

## How It Works

### Search Process
- The search recursively scans each repository in your organization using a **LIKE statement** to match the package name.
- Only **direct (first-party) dependencies** are returned in the results.

### API Endpoint
A new API endpoint is available for programmatic access:

```
GET /api/v1/organizations/{organizationName}/dependency-components?search={packageName}
```

#### Response Fields
   Field                  | Description                          |

 | `componentDependencyId`| Unique identifier for the dependency |
 | `dependencyPurl`       | Package URL (purl) of the dependency |
 | `organizationId`       | ID of the organization               |

## Use Cases

- **Security Audits:** Quickly check if a vulnerable package is used anywhere in your organization.
- **Compliance:** Verify that only approved package versions are in use.
- **Dependency Management:** Identify and update outdated or risky dependencies across multiple projects.

---

## Permissions

- Only users with **Admin** or **Owner** roles can access this feature and the associated API endpoint.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Navigate to your **Organization Page** in DevGuard.
2. Click on the new **Package Search** tab.
3. Enter the package name (e.g., `xz-util`) in the search bar.
4. View the results, which include:
   - Repositories where the package is found
   - Version of the package in each repository
   - Artifacts containing the package

---

## Integration

This feature integrates seamlessly with DevGuard’s existing SBOM and dependency management tools, providing a unified view of your organization’s software supply chain.

---

## Notes

- The search is case-insensitive and supports partial matches.
- Only direct dependencies are included in the results.
