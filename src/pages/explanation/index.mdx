# Explanation

The Explanation section provides comprehensive understanding of DevGuard's concepts, architecture, and methodologies. Unlike tutorials (which teach you how) or how-to guides (which solve specific problems), explanations clarify *why* things work the way they do and the reasoning behind design decisions.

## What You'll Find Here

This section covers the fundamental concepts, architectural decisions, and theoretical foundations that make DevGuard work. Each topic explores underlying principles, trade-offs, and contextual understanding needed to use DevGuard effectively.

<Callout type="info" emoji="📚">
  Explanations are learning-oriented—they're designed to deepen your understanding of DevGuard's systems, not just teach you to use them. For practical usage instructions, see the [How-To Guides](/how-to) or [Tutorials](/tutorials).

## How to Use This Section

**Learning Path**: Start with Core Concepts to understand DevGuard's structure, then explore Vulnerability Management and Compliance based on your role and needs.

**Reference Material**: Use explanations as reference when you need deeper understanding of why DevGuard works a certain way or makes specific design decisions.

**Context for Guides**: Explanations provide context for How-To Guides and Tutorials. If a guide references concepts you're unfamiliar with, return here for deeper understanding.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  Explanations answer "why" and "what"—they build mental models. For "how" answers, see [How-To Guides](/how-to). For step-by-step learning, see [Tutorials](/tutorials).
