# Vulnerability Risk Assessment Methodology

Effective vulnerability management requires more than identifying security flaws—it demands accurate risk assessment to prioritize remediation efforts. This methodology explains the fundamental concepts and factors that determine vulnerability risk, and how DevGuard implements a multi-dimensional approach to vulnerability risk calculation.

Risk assessment transforms raw vulnerability data into actionable intelligence by answering a critical question: *Which vulnerabilities pose the greatest threat to your applications?* This requires understanding not just the technical severity of a flaw, but its exploitability, your organizational context, and the attack surface it exposes.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Risk scores support remediation prioritization by highlighting vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat to your applications. However, they do not represent absolute measurements of risk, nor do they account for all possible environmental factors specific to your deployment. Even a low-risk vulnerability may be critical in certain contexts, and vice versa.

## The Foundation: CIA Triad

Information security risk assessment begins with the **CIA Triad**—the three fundamental security objectives that define what we aim to protect[^1]. Understanding these principles is essential to comprehending vulnerability impact:

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized entities. A breach of confidentiality occurs when unauthorized parties gain access to sensitive data. The impact depends on the sensitivity of the exposed information—from proprietary business data to personal information protected by regulations like GDPR.

**Example Impact**: A vulnerability allowing unauthorized database access could expose customer credentials, leading to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and potential identity theft affecting users.

### Integrity

Integrity guarantees that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered except by authorized parties. Compromise of integrity can be subtle yet devastating—unauthorized modifications may go undetected while corrupting critical systems or data.

**Example Impact**: A vulnerability enabling SQL injection could allow attackers to modify transaction records in a financial system, leading to fraudulent transfers or corrupted audit trails that undermine trust in the entire system.

### Availability

Availability ensures that authorized users can access information and systems when needed. Denial of service attacks or system crashes resulting from vulnerabilities directly impact business continuity and user experience.

**Example Impact**: A vulnerability causing application crashes under specific input could be exploited to launch denial-of-service attacks, making critical services unavailable during peak business hours.

### CIA in Risk Assessment

The CIA triad informs risk assessment through **security requirements**—organizational policies that define the relative importance of these three objectives for different systems. A public marketing website may prioritize availability over confidentiality, while a patient database demands maximum confidentiality. These security requirements directly influence how vulnerability impact is calculated.

  DevGuard allows you to configure CIA security requirements per repository in your project settings. These environmental metrics adjust vulnerability risk scores to reflect your specific organizational priorities—ensuring risk assessments align with your actual security posture rather than generic severity ratings.
</Callout>

## Threat Intelligence: Exploit Prediction

Understanding vulnerability severity is insufficient without assessing **exploit probability**—the likelihood that a vulnerability will actually be exploited in the wild. This is where threat intelligence transforms theoretical risk into practical prioritization.

### EPSS: Exploit Prediction Scoring System

The [**Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)**](https://www.first.org/epss/) applies machine learning to historical exploit data and current threat intelligence to estimate the probability of a vulnerability being exploited within the next 30 days[^2]. EPSS scores range from 0% (extremely unlikely) to 100% (highly probable).

EPSS analyzes multiple signals to generate predictions:
- **Exploit code availability**: Whether proof-of-concept or weaponized exploits exist
- **Threat actor activity**: Observable scanning or exploitation attempts in the wild
- **Vulnerability characteristics**: Technical features that correlate with exploitation
- **Temporal factors**: Time since disclosure and patch availability

**Example**: Consider two vulnerabilities with identical CVSS scores of 8.5 (High severity—we'll explain CVSS scoring in detail shortly):
- Vulnerability A: EPSS score of **0.8%** (low probability)
- Vulnerability B: EPSS score of **75.2%** (high probability)

Vulnerability B demands immediate attention despite identical technical severity, as active exploitation is highly probable. Vulnerability A, while serious, represents lower immediate risk and can be scheduled for routine patching.

### The Value of Exploit Intelligence

EPSS represents a paradigm shift from purely severity-based prioritization to **risk-based prioritization**. Research by FIRST.org demonstrates that EPSS significantly outperforms CVSS severity alone in predicting which vulnerabilities will be exploited, allowing organizations to focus limited security resources on the vulnerabilities that matter most.

  DevGuard integrates real-time EPSS data from FIRST.org and recalculates vulnerability risks multiple times per day as new threat intelligence becomes available. This ensures your risk assessments remain current with the evolving threat landscape.
</Callout>

## Technical Severity: CVSS Scoring

The [**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**](https://www.first.org/cvss/) provides a standardized framework for assessing the technical characteristics and severity of vulnerabilities[^3]. CVSS translates complex technical details into a numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0, enabling consistent communication about vulnerability severity across organizations.

### Base Metrics: Intrinsic Vulnerability Characteristics

CVSS Base Metrics capture the fundamental properties of a vulnerability that remain constant across different environments:

#### Exploitability Metrics

**Attack Vector (AV)**: Determines how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability:
- **Network (N)**: Exploitable remotely over networks (highest risk)
- **Adjacent (A)**: Requires local network access (e.g., same subnet)
- **Local (L)**: Requires local system access
- **Physical (P)**: Requires physical device access (lowest risk)

**Attack Complexity (AC)**: Measures exploitation difficulty:
- **Low (L)**: Straightforward exploitation with consistent results
- **High (H)**: Requires specific conditions or significant preparation

**Privileges Required (PR)**: Authentication level needed:
- **None (N)**: No authentication required (highest risk)
- **Low (L)**: Basic user privileges needed
- **High (H)**: Administrative privileges required (lowest risk)

**User Interaction (UI)**: Whether exploitation requires victim action:
- **None (N)**: Fully autonomous exploitation (highest risk)
- **Required (R)**: Requires user action like clicking a link

#### Scope

**Scope (S)** captures whether a vulnerability can affect resources beyond its original security context—for example, escaping a container to compromise the host system:
- **Unchanged (U)**: Impact limited to the vulnerable component
- **Changed (C)**: Can affect other components or security boundaries

#### Impact Metrics

Impact metrics directly map to the CIA Triad, measuring potential consequences:

**Confidentiality Impact (C)**: Unauthorized information disclosure potential
**Integrity Impact (I)**: Unauthorized data modification potential  
**Availability Impact (A)**: Service disruption potential

Each impact metric is rated as:
- **None (N)**: No impact to this security objective
- **Low (L)**: Limited impact or information disclosure
- **High (H)**: Total compromise of this security objective

### Environmental Metrics: Organizational Context

While Base Metrics provide consistent severity ratings, **Environmental Metrics** allow organizations to adjust scores based on their specific security requirements and deployment context. This is where the CIA security requirements discussed earlier directly influence risk calculation.

CVSS Environmental Metrics include:
- **Modified Base Metrics**: Adjustments to base metrics based on specific deployment
- **Security Requirements**: The relative importance of CIA to the organization (Confidentiality Requirement, Integrity Requirement, Availability Requirement)

**Example**: A vulnerability with High confidentiality impact has different risk levels depending on security requirements:
- Public documentation server (CR: Low) → Lower adjusted risk
- Medical records database (CR: High) → Higher adjusted risk

The environmental score reflects **real-world impact** in your specific infrastructure, not just theoretical vulnerability severity.

### Temporal Metrics: Threat Evolution

CVSS Temporal Metrics capture how vulnerability risk changes over time:
- **Exploit Code Maturity**: From theoretical to functional exploits
- **Remediation Level**: Availability of patches or workarounds
- **Report Confidence**: Verification level of the vulnerability

DevGuard tracks exploit availability through continuous monitoring of:
- **GitHub repositories**: Public exploit code and proof-of-concepts
- **Exploit Database**: Curated collection of weaponized exploits
- **Security advisories**: Vendor and researcher disclosures

The absence of available exploits substantially reduces practical risk, as exploitation requires significant attacker effort and expertise.

## Contextual Factors: Attack Surface Analysis

Beyond vulnerability characteristics and threat intelligence, the **position of a vulnerability within your application architecture** significantly impacts exploitability and actual risk.

### Component Depth: Dependency Tree Analysis

Modern applications rely on complex dependency trees where libraries depend on other libraries, creating multiple levels of transitive dependencies. A vulnerability's depth in this tree directly correlates with exploitation difficulty and probability.

**The Depth Principle**: Vulnerabilities in direct dependencies are more likely to be exploitable through your application than those in deep transitive dependencies because:

1. **Code Reachability**: Deep dependencies are often abstraction layers away from your application code, reducing the likelihood that vulnerable code paths are actually executed
2. **Isolation**: Multiple dependency layers create natural isolation boundaries that complicate exploitation
3. **Attack Surface**: Direct dependencies expose more of their API surface to your code, while deep dependencies are often only partially utilized

**Example Scenario**:
```
Your Application
└── Web Framework (depth 1) ← Directly called by your code
    └── HTTP Parser (depth 2) ← Called by framework
        └── String Utilities (depth 3) ← Called by parser
```

A vulnerability in the String Utilities library (depth 3) is less likely to be exploitable than one in the Web Framework (depth 1), even if both have identical CVSS scores. The framework vulnerability is directly exposed through your API routes, while the string utility vulnerability requires specific parser inputs that may never occur in practice.

### Depth as a Risk Modifier

Risk assessment methodology should account for this structural context. BSI IT-Grundschutz emphasizes that risk assessment must consider "the specific conditions of the information network"[^4]—which includes dependency architecture. DevGuard incorporates component depth as a risk modifier, reducing risk scores for deeper dependencies to reflect reduced exploitability.

## DevGuard's Risk Assessment Approach

DevGuard synthesizes these multiple risk dimensions into a unified risk score using the following formula:

```
Risk = ((CVSS Environmental Score × (EPSS + 1)) / 2) / Component Depth
```

This formula balances four critical dimensions:

1. **Technical Severity**: CVSS Environmental Score (Base + Environmental Metrics)
2. **Exploit Probability**: EPSS score indicating likelihood of active exploitation
3. **Organizational Context**: Security requirements (CIA) embedded in environmental score
4. **Structural Context**: Component depth representing attack surface

### Formula Rationale

The formula implements several key principles:

**Multiplicative EPSS Integration**: Multiplying CVSS by `(EPSS + 1)` ensures that high-probability exploits significantly increase risk scores while preventing zero EPSS scores from eliminating risk entirely. The division by 2 normalizes the result to a 0-10 scale.

**Environmental Adjustment**: Using CVSS Environmental Score rather than Base Score ensures organizational security requirements directly influence risk calculation—a vulnerability affecting high-priority systems receives appropriately elevated risk scores.

**Depth Attenuation**: Dividing by component depth reduces risk for deep transitive dependencies, reflecting reduced exploitability while maintaining non-zero risk for all vulnerabilities.

**Example Calculation**:
- CVSS-BE: 8.5
- EPSS: 15.2% (0.152)
- Component Depth: 2

```
Risk = ((8.5 × (0.152 + 1)) / 2) / 2
     = ((8.5 × 1.152) / 2) / 2
     = (9.792 / 2) / 2
     = 4.896 / 2
     = 2.448
```

This vulnerability, despite high CVSS severity, receives a moderate risk score due to low exploit probability and indirect dependency position.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔄">
  DevGuard recalculates vulnerability risks multiple times per day as new threat intelligence becomes available. You can configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications when risk scores change, and if you have issue tracker synchronization enabled (GitLab, GitHub, or Jira), changes will be automatically reflected in your tickets.
</Callout>

## Continuous Monitoring and Data Integration

Effective risk assessment requires current, comprehensive threat intelligence. DevGuard's approach leverages the [Aggregated Vulnerability Database](/concepts/aggregated-vulnerability-database), which consolidates data from over 22 authoritative sources:

### Vulnerability Intelligence Sources
- **NVD** (National Vulnerability Database) - NIST's comprehensive vulnerability database
- **OSV** (Open Source Vulnerabilities) - Google's open-source vulnerability database
- **GitHub Security Advisories** - Ecosystem-specific vulnerability reports
- **Multiple ecosystem databases** - NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Maven, and others

### Threat Intelligence Sources
- **EPSS** (FIRST.org) - Real-time exploit prediction scoring
- **Exploit Database** - Curated collection of public exploits
- **GitHub exploit repositories** - Proof-of-concept code and weaponized exploits

### Continuous Updates

NIST Special Publication 800-40 Rev. 4 emphasizes that "patch and vulnerability management is an ongoing process"[^5]. DevGuard implements this principle through:

- **Multiple daily updates**: Risk scores recalculate as new EPSS data, exploits, or security advisories emerge
- **Real-time notifications**: Webhook integrations alert teams immediately when risk scores change
- **Automated ticket updates**: Issue tracker synchronization reflects current risk in existing tickets

This continuous monitoring ensures risk assessments remain aligned with the evolving threat landscape rather than representing point-in-time snapshots.

## Best Practices for Risk-Based Vulnerability Management

1. **Prioritize by Risk Score**: Focus remediation efforts on high-risk vulnerabilities first, recognizing that not all "High" severity vulnerabilities demand immediate action

2. **Consider Environmental Context**: Review and configure security requirements (CIA) to reflect your organizational priorities—generic risk scores may not align with your specific threat model

3. **Monitor Risk Evolution**: Track how risk scores change over time as threat intelligence evolves. A vulnerability with low exploit probability today may become critical if public exploits emerge

4. **Balance Automation with Human Judgment**: Risk scores guide prioritization but cannot capture all nuances of your environment. Security teams should review high-risk findings with organizational context

5. **Integrate into Development Workflow**: Embed risk assessment into CI/CD pipelines to catch high-risk vulnerabilities before they reach production

6. **Regular Security Requirement Reviews**: Periodically reassess CIA security requirements as systems evolve and business priorities shift

7. **Automate Notifications**: Configure webhooks and issue tracker synchronization for timely awareness of changing risk profiles

8. **Document Risk Acceptance**: When accepting risks for business reasons, document the rationale and set review dates—accepted risks should be periodically reassessed as threat landscape evolves

## Conclusion

Vulnerability risk assessment transforms security from reactive fire-fighting to strategic risk management. By combining technical severity (CVSS), exploit probability (EPSS), organizational context (CIA security requirements), and structural factors (component depth), organizations can make informed decisions about security resource allocation.

DevGuard's methodology implements this multi-dimensional approach through continuous monitoring, comprehensive threat intelligence, and contextual risk calculation—enabling development and security teams to focus on vulnerabilities that truly matter.
