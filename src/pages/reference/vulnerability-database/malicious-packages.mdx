# OSSF Malicious Packages

The OSSF Malicious Packages repository is an open-source database containing reports of malicious packages identified across different open-source package repositories. 

## Scope 
Instead of listing unintentional weaknesses like CVEs, malicious packages focus more on intentional malicious patterns like typosquatting attacks, account takeovers, dependency confusion, or manifest confusion, just to name a few. 


The OSSF explicitly defines malicious packages as those that, when installed or used, compromise system confidentiality, availability, and/or integrity.

## Data Access

Malicious packages can be accessed via the public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages), located in the osv directory.
Additionally, the OSSF publishes [up-to-date statistics](https://ossf.github.io/malicious-packages/stats/) on total malicious packages. 

## Malicious Packages in DevGuard

DevGuard will be using Malicious Packages in the upcoming purl inspector:
