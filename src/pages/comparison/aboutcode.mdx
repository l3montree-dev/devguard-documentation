# AboutCode vs DevGuard

This page provides a comparison between the **[AboutCode Suite](https://aboutcode.org/)** and **DevGuard**, highlighting key areas of overlap and differentiation.

---

## Core Philosophy

- **AboutCode:** Specialist toolset with manual workflows and detailed control.
- **DevGuard:** Developer enablement through simplicity, automation, and actionable guidance.

> DevGuard is **not an SCA scanner**. It acts as an orchestrator and compliance hub, leveraging attestations (e.g., in-toto) and integrating findings from multiple security tools.

Our mission: **Make secure software development accessible to engineering teams**—through reduced complexity, prioritized actions, and a high degree of automation.

## Shared Ground

| Feature                            | AboutCode / VulnerableCode                           | DevGuard                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vulnerability Data Aggregation     | Aggregated vulnerability database (VulnerableCode)    | Aggregated vulnerability data plus additional sources (exploit PoCs from GitHub, DepsDev metadata like Scorecard, license info, repository metrics) |
| VEX Support (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) | CRAVEX                                         | VEX document export available |

We consider **VulnerableCode** a potential integration point for enhancing DevGuard’s vulnerability intelligence, while supplementing it with additional data sources.

## Key Differentiators

| Category                      | AboutCode (DejaCode, VulnerableCode, CRAVEX)                | DevGuard                                            |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Product Scope**              | Primarily SCA (Software Composition Analysis) and license compliance | Compliance as Code: integrates SCA, SAST, secret scanning, IaC scanning, etc. |
| **Target Audience**            | Security specialists, SCA analysts                          | Software developers (non-security experts)          |
| **UX/UI Philosophy**           | Detail-rich, specialist-oriented                            | Developer-first, streamlined UX with clear guidance and prioritization |
| **Scanning**                   | Focus on SCA tooling                                        | Not an SCA scanner itself; supports SBOM/SARIF ingestion and wraps essential scans via CLI for simplicity |
| **Developer Integrations**     | Manual processes, analyst-centric                           | GitHub/GitLab integration, issue synchronization, automated workflows, developer-friendly setup |
| **Risk Handling**              | SCA-focused                                                 | Clear separation of **Dependency Risk Handling** (SCA) and **Code Risk Handling** (SAST, Secrets, IaC, etc.) |
| **Automation Focus**           | Manual analysis typical                                     | High automation, minimal user burden, guided vulnerability management |
