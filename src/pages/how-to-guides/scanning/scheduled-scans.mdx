# Scheduled Scans

DevGuard provides automatic scheduled scanning even when no code changes occur. The platform continuously rescans your repositories and updates vulnerability information throughout the day to detect new findings.

## What the Scheduled Scans Do

DevGuard's daemon system ensures that all repositories and assets are automatically rescanned on a regular schedule to detect new vulnerabilities as they emerge.

**The automated scanning pipeline processes each asset through the following steps:**

1. **Fetch Asset Details**: Retrieves the latest repository information and metadata
2. **Delete Old Asset Versions**: Removes outdated asset versions to maintain data integrity
3. **Scan Assets**: Performs comprehensive security scans on all components and dependencies
4. **Sync Upstream**: Downloads the latest vulnerability data from external security databases
5. **Auto-Reopen Tickets**: Automatically reopens previously resolved tickets when new CVEs affect existing components
6. **Recalculate Risk**: Updates risk scores and assessments based on the latest vulnerability data
7. **Sync Tickets**: Synchronizes findings with your configured issue tracking systems
8. **Collect Statistics**: Updates project metrics, dashboards, and compliance reports
