# Upload SBOM

Upload an existing Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to DevGuard for vulnerability analysis. This is useful when you already have an SBOM generated by another tool and want DevGuard to scan it against known vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Docker installed on your system
- A personal access token from DevGuard (create one in user settings)
- A repository created in DevGuard
- An existing SBOM file in CycloneDX format (JSON)

## Upload SBOM File

Upload a CycloneDX SBOM file for vulnerability analysis:

```bash copy
docker run -v "$(PWD):/dev/app" ghcr.io/l3montree-dev/devguard/scanner:main-latest \
  devguard-scanner sbom \
    /dev/app/sbom.json \
    --assetName="myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo" \
    --apiUrl="https://api.devguard.org" \
    --token="YOUR_TOKEN"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `sbom.json` with the path to your SBOM file. Only CycloneDX-formatted SBOMs (JSON or XML) are supported.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo` with your repository's slug. You can copy this from the URL when viewing your repository in the DevGuard UI.
</Callout>

## What the Scanner Does

1. **Parses SBOM**: Reads and validates your CycloneDX SBOM file
2. **Scans Components**: Analyzes all software components listed in the SBOM
3. **Checks Vulnerabilities**: Cross-references each component against DevGuard's vulnerability database
4. **Reports Findings**: Returns detected vulnerabilities with severity scores and remediation guidance
5. **Updates Repository**: Syncs findings with your DevGuard repository for tracking

**Verify it worked:** Navigate to your repository in DevGuard. You'll see detected vulnerabilities listed with affected components and fix recommendations.

## SBOM Generation

If you don't have an existing SBOM, you can generate one using tools like:

- **Syft**: For generating SBOMs from container images and filesystems
- **CycloneDX tools**: Official CycloneDX Maven, Gradle, and npm plugins
- **SPDX tools**: Convert SPDX SBOMs to CycloneDX format
- **DevGuard SCA**: Use DevGuard's own SCA scanning to generate SBOMs

## Advanced Options

Fail the command based on risk level:

```bash copy
--failOnRisk=critical  # Options: low, medium, high, critical (default: critical)
--failOnCVSS=critical  # Options: low, medium, high, critical (default: critical)
```

Set a custom origin to track where the SBOM came from:

```bash copy
--origin="my-sbom-tool"  # Default is "DEFAULT"
```

Specify which artifact this SBOM represents:

```bash copy
--artifactName="pkg:devguard/orgSlug/projectSlug/repoSlug"  # Default is based on your asset
```

<Callout type="info">
  The origin flag helps you track which tools or systems generated your SBOMs. This is useful when you have multiple SBOMs from different sources for the same project.
