# Upload VEX

Upload a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document to DevGuard. VEX documents allow you to communicate the status of vulnerabilities in your software components to DevGuard, enabling more accurate vulnerability tracking and compliance reporting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Docker installed on your system
- A personal access token from DevGuard (create one in user settings)
- A repository created in DevGuard
- An existing VEX document in CycloneDX format (JSON or XML)

## Upload VEX Document

Upload a VEX document to update vulnerability statuses:

```bash copy
docker run -v "$(PWD):/dev/app" ghcr.io/l3montree-dev/devguard/scanner:main-latest \
  devguard-scanner vex \
    /dev/app/vex.json \
    --assetName="myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo" \
    --apiUrl="https://api.devguard.org" \
    --token="YOUR_TOKEN"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `vex.json` with the path to your VEX document. Only CycloneDX-formatted VEX documents (JSON or XML) are supported.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo` with your repository's slug. You can copy this from the URL when viewing your repository in the DevGuard UI.
</Callout>

## What DevGuard Does with VEX

1. **Parses VEX Document**: Reads and validates your CycloneDX VEX file
2. **Extracts Vulnerability Status**: Identifies the status (affected, not affected, fixed, under investigation) for each vulnerability
3. **Updates Vulnerability Records**: Syncs the VEX status information with matching vulnerabilities in DevGuard
4. **Creates Audit Trail**: Records VEX uploads as events for compliance tracking
5. **Processes External References**: Handles external VEX references if the document includes them

**Verify it worked:** Navigate to your repository in DevGuard. You'll see vulnerability statuses updated based on the VEX document, with audit events showing the upload.

## Understanding VEX Status

A VEX document communicates vulnerability status using these states:

- **affected**: The vulnerability impacts this component (requires mitigation)
- **not affected**: The component is not affected by this vulnerability
- **fixed**: The vulnerability has been fixed in a newer version
- **under investigation**: The impact is being assessed

You can optionally provide justifications for "not affected" findings to document why the vulnerability doesn't impact your component.

## VEX Generation

VEX documents can be generated using:

- **CycloneDX BOM tools**: Native VEX support in CycloneDX v1.4+
- **CISA OpenVEX**: Official format for VEX documents
- **Supplier tools**: Many vendors provide VEX documents for their components
- **Manual creation**: Create VEX documents to communicate your own vulnerability assessments

## Advanced Options

Set a custom origin to track where the VEX came from:

```bash copy
--origin="vendor-supplied-vex"  # Default is "vex-upload"
```

Specify which artifact this VEX applies to:

```bash copy
--artifactName="pkg:devguard/orgSlug/projectSlug/repoSlug"  # Default is based on your asset
```

Specify Git reference information:

```bash copy
--ref="v1.2.3"                 # Git reference (branch, tag, or commit)
--defaultRef="main"            # Default Git reference to use
--isTag=true                   # Indicates if the reference is a tag
```

<Callout type="info">
  VEX documents are powerful for communicating vulnerability assessments from suppliers or third-party tools. When you upload a VEX, DevGuard will sync the vulnerability status information to update your dependency vulnerability records.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  External references in VEX documents are automatically fetched and processed. This allows for modular VEX documents where components reference other SBOM or VEX sources.
