# Customize the UI

DevGuard allows you to customize the web interface with custom CSS and JavaScript, as well as configure legal and contact information.

## Requirements

- A self hosted DevGuard installation (Kubernetes or Docker Compose)
- Access to modify the Helm chart `values.yaml` or Docker Compose environment variables

## Custom Styling and Behavior

You can inject custom CSS and JavaScript into the DevGuard web interface by providing URLs to your theme files. These files are loaded in the root layout and applied globally.

### Helm Chart Configuration

Add the following to your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
web:
  # Custom theme URLs (leave empty to use default theme)
  themeCssUrl: "https://your-storage.example.com/custom-theme.css"
  themeJsUrl: "https://your-storage.example.com/custom-theme.js"
```

### Docker Compose / Environment Variables

When running with Docker Compose or directly with environment variables, configure for web service:

```yaml
environment:
  - THEME_CSS_URL=https://your-storage.example.com/custom-theme.css
  - THEME_JS_URL=https://your-storage.example.com/custom-theme.js
```

<Callout type="info">
The CSS file is loaded as a stylesheet link, and the JavaScript file is loaded as a deferred script in the HTML document.
</Callout>

## Legal and Contact Information

Configure links to your privacy policy, terms of use, imprint, and account deletion contact email.

### Helm Chart Configuration

```yaml
web:
  privacyPolicyLink: "https://example.com/privacy-policy"
  termsOfUseLink: "https://example.com/terms-of-use"
  imprintLink: "https://example.com/imprint"
  accountDeletionMail: "privacy@example.com"
```

### Docker Compose / Environment Variables

```yaml
environment:
  - PRIVACY_POLICY_LINK=https://example.com/privacy-policy
  - TERMS_OF_USE_LINK=https://example.com/terms-of-use
  - IMPRINT_LINK=https://example.com/imprint
  - ACCOUNT_DELETION_MAIL=privacy@example.com
```
