# Customize Risk Scores

Adjust vulnerability risk assessments to reflect your asset's operational impact. DevGuard uses CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) requirements to calculate environmental risk scores and automatically create tickets based on severity thresholds.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard organization, project, and asset
- Owner or admin role for the asset
- Understanding of your application's data sensitivity and availability criticality

## Set CIA Requirements

CIA requirements define how a vulnerability's impact should be assessed for your specific asset:

- **Confidentiality (C)**: Data exposure impact (Low/Medium/High)
- **Integrity (I)**: Data modification impact (Low/Medium/High)
- **Availability (A)**: Service downtime impact (Low/Medium/High)

### Via Web UI

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Asset** 
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. Under **Requirements**, configure:
   - **Confidentiality**: Low, Medium, or High (Default: High)
   - **Integrity**: Low, Medium, or High (Default: High)
   - **Availability**: Low, Medium, or High (Default: High)
4. Click **Save**

<Callout type="info">
  CIA requirements apply to all existing and future vulnerability assessments for this asset.
</Callout>

## Configure Automatic Ticket Creation

Create tickets automatically when vulnerabilities exceed your risk thresholds:

### Via Web UI

1. In **Asset Settings**, go to **Vulnerability Management**
2. Toggle **Reporting Range** to enable automatic tickets
3. Set **CVSS Threshold** (0-10, default: 8.0)
   - Tickets auto-create for vulnerabilities with CVSS ≥ this value
4. Set **Risk Threshold** (0-10, default: 8.0)
   - Tickets auto-create for vulnerabilities with environmental risk score ≥ this value
![Select Risk Reporting Range](../../../assets/risk-based-ticket-thresholds-gui.png)

5. Click **Save**

Changes apply immediately to new vulnerabilities.

<Callout type="info">
  **Risk Threshold** considers your CIA requirements. **CVSS Threshold** uses the base CVSS score without environmental adjustments.
</Callout>

## Set Network Exposure

Inform DevGuard if your asset is reachable from the internet:

### Via Web UI
![Select Reachable from Internet](../../../assets/reachable-from-the-internet-asset-gui.png)

In **Asset Settings**, toggle **Reachable from Internet** to contextualize risk assessments.

## Configure Vulnerability Auto-Reopen

Automatically reopen accepted vulnerabilities after a period to re-evaluate fixes:
![Select Vulnerability Auto-Reopen Period](../../../assets/vulnerability-auto-reopen-gui.png)


### Via Web UI
In **Asset Settings** under **Vulnerability Management**, select auto-reopen period: 30, 60, 120, 180, or 360 days.

Accepted vulnerabilities will reopen automatically for reassessment.
