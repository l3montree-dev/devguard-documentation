# Create Vulnerability Events

Track vulnerability lifecycle with events. Record assessments, decisions, and actions taken on vulnerabilities to maintain a complete audit trail for compliance and remediation tracking.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard organization, project, and asset
- Read access to vulnerabilities in your asset
- Write access to create events (typically Owner or Admin role)
- Identified which vulnerability you want to document

## Event Types

DevGuard supports these vulnerability events:

| Event | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Accepted** | Document a deliberate risk acceptance | You've assessed and accepted the risk |
| **False Positive** | Mark the vulnerability as not applicable | The vulnerability doesn't affect your code or environment |
| **Fixed** | Record vulnerability remediation | You've fixed the vulnerability in code |
| **Reopened** | Reopen a closed vulnerability | An accepted/false positive requires re-evaluation |
| **Mitigate** | Create a ticket for remediation | You're creating a tracking issue for the team |
| **Comment** | Add notes without changing status | You need to provide context or updates |

## Create an Event

### Via Web UI

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Repository** → **Vulnerabilities**
2. Click on a vulnerability to open its details
3. In the **Events** section at the bottom, you'll see the event history
4. Select an action from the available options:
   - **Accept Risk**: Mark as intentionally accepted
   - **False Positive**: Mark as not applicable
   - **Create Ticket**: Open a mitigate event
   - **Reopen**: Reopen if previously marked as false positive or accepted
   - **Add Comment**: Document additional context

5. Provide required information:
   - **Justification**: Explain your decision
   - **Mechanical Justification** (for false positives): Select the reason
6. Click **Save**

The event is recorded immediately with your user ID and timestamp.

## Event Timeline

The **Events** section shows a complete audit trail:

- **Detected**: When DevGuard first discovered the vulnerability
- **User Actions**: All manual events (accepted, reopened, fixed, etc.) with user ID and timestamp
- **Automatic Updates**: Risk score recalculations and system events

This timeline is included in compliance reports (CSAF) and supports regulatory audits.

## Best Practices

### Document Decisions
Every event should explain the decision made:
- **Acceptance**: Explain business impact and mitigations
- **False Positive**: Specify which reason applies
- **Reopened**: Explain what changed
- **Fixed**: Mention the patch or update version

### Regular Review
1. Review accepted vulnerabilities monthly
2. Reopen if circumstances change
3. Follow up on open tickets
4. Close events only when truly fixed
