# Risk Mitigation Guides Overview

DevGuard helps you identify and manage various types of security risks throughout your software development lifecycle.
Understanding these risk categories is essential for maintaining a secure and compliant application.

## Available Mitigation Guides

These docs provide mitigation guides for some types of security risks you can handle with DevGuard:

- 🔐 **[Secret Scanning](/how-to-guides/risk-mitigation-guides/secret-scanning)** - Learn how to handle exposed secrets, API keys, and credentials found in your codebase
- 🔍 **[Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](/how-to-guides/risk-mitigation-guides/sast)** - Address code quality and security issues identified through static analysis
- 📦 **[Software Composition Analysis (SCA)](/how-to-guides/risk-mitigation-guides/software-composition-analysis)** - Manage vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies and third-party libraries
- ☁️ **[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](/how-to-guides/risk-mitigation-guides/iac)** - Secure your infrastructure configurations and prevent misconfigurations
- 🐳 **[Container Scanning](/how-to-guides/risk-mitigation-guides/container-scanning)** - Identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your container images

## Types of Risks in DevGuard

DevGuard categorizes security risks into several key areas:

### Code Risks

Code risks originate from your own codebase and represent vulnerabilities or security issues introduced during development. These include:

- **Secrets and Credentials** - Accidentally committed API keys, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information
- **Code Quality Issues** - Security vulnerabilities identified through static analysis, such as SQL injection, XSS, insecure cryptography,
  and other common weaknesses

### Dependency Risks

Dependency risks stem from third-party libraries and packages used in your project:

- **Known Vulnerabilities** - Published CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in your dependencies
- **Transitive Dependencies** - Vulnerabilities in dependencies of your dependencies
- **Container Image Vulnerabilities** - Security issues in base images and packages within your containers

### License Risks

License risks relate to the legal compliance of your project's dependencies:

- **License Classification** - Ensuring all dependency licenses are known and OSI approved

### Compliance Risks (WIP)

Future versions of DevGuard will help you manage compliance as code based on Rego policies.
You will be able to define and enforce organizational policies to ensure adherence to security standards and best practices.
