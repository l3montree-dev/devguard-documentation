# Set Up GitHub Integration

DevGuard integrates with GitHub to provide a seamless experience for developers. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the integration.

## Steps

<Steps>

### Go to Organization Settings & Click on `Add a GitHub App`

### Select Repositories to Integrate with DevGuard

You can choose all repositories or specific repositories. Then, click on `Install`.

If the integration is successful, you will see your chosen user or organization in the organization settings. You can change the settings at any time by clicking on `Manage GitHub App`. You can also add more repositories by clicking on `Add a GitHub App`.

### Create a Personal Access Token

Go to the `security control center` of the asset and click on `Create Personal Access Token`. Then copy the token.

You can find more information about the DevGuard Personal Access Token [here](/how-to-guides/security/access-control/api-tokens).

### Store the Token in Your GitHub Repository Secrets

For instructions on storing the token in your GitHub repository secrets, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

### Add a Pipeline Configuration File

You can now copy the code snippet and add it to your pipeline configuration file.

If you don't have a pipeline configuration file, create one by adding a new file in the root directory of your repository. The file should be located in the `.github/workflows/` directory and have a `.yml` extension. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow) for more details on creating a pipeline configuration file.

Finally, push the changes to your repository.

You can find more information about the pipeline configuration file [here](/reference/github-workflows/full).

You have successfully integrated your GitHub repository with DevGuard. You can now start using DevGuard to secure your codebase.
