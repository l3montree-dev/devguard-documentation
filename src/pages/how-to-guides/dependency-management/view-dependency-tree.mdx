# View Dependency Tree

Explore your application's complete dependency tree in an interactive graph. Understand which components depend on which, identify vulnerable transitive dependencies, and trace the path from your application to any component.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard organization, project, and asset
- At least one scan completed (SBOM uploaded or auto-scanned)
- Read access to view dependency information
- An asset version to analyze

## Access the Dependency Graph

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Asset**
2. Select an **Asset Version** (branch or tag)
3. Click **Dependencies** → **Graph** in the left navigation

The interactive dependency graph displays:
- **Nodes**: Each dependency (component) in your tree
- **Edges**: Relationships showing which components depend on which
- **Color Coding**: Risk levels (green: low, yellow: medium, orange: high, red: critical)
- **Size**: Risk proportional to severity

## Filter by Artifact

If your asset has multiple build artifacts (different container images, JARs, etc.):

1. In the **Artifact Selector** at the top, choose a specific artifact
2. The graph updates to show dependencies for only that artifact
3. Leave empty to view across all artifacts

This helps identify which artifacts use risky dependencies.

## Display All Dependencies

By default, the graph shows only vulnerable dependencies:

1. Toggle **Display all dependencies** switch in the top-right
2. The graph expands to show every dependency, including safe ones
3. This is useful for:
   - Understanding complete supply chain
   - Identifying transitive dependency chains
   - Finding dependency conflicts or redundancies

<Callout type="info">
  Displaying all dependencies can create large graphs. For projects with hundreds of dependencies, consider filtering by artifact first.
</Callout>

## Interact with the Graph

- **Zoom**: Scroll to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around
- **Fullscreen**: Click the fullscreen icon (top-right) for a larger view
- **Mini Map**: Bottom-left corner shows overview of the entire graph
- **Click Components**: Click on a component node to see details about that dependency

## View Component Details

When you click on a component node:

1. A details panel opens showing:
   - Component name and version
   - Vulnerabilities affecting it (if any)
   - Package homepage and documentation links
   - OpenSSF Scorecard rating
   - License information

2. You can also:
   - View vulnerabilities for this component
   - Check the path to the component
   - View dependency details dialog

## Trace Paths to Components

To understand how a vulnerable component is included:

1. Click on a vulnerable node in the graph
2. Click **Path to component** in the details dialog
3. A highlighted path shows:
   - Your application at the top
   - Each dependency level down to the vulnerable component
   - The dependency chain responsible for including it

This is essential for understanding:
- Whether you can exclude the vulnerable component
- What you'd need to update to fix it
- If it's a critical path dependency

<Callout type="info">
  Transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) are shown with dotted lines in some views. They're often harder to remediate because they're pulled in by other libraries.
</Callout>

## Identify Risk Hotspots

Use the graph to find:

1. **High-Risk Dependencies**: Orange and red nodes indicate critical vulnerabilities
2. **Bottleneck Components**: Nodes with many incoming edges (heavily depended on)
3. **Outdated Packages**: Check the version numbers against latest releases
4. **Duplicates**: The same component at different versions (version conflicts)

## Switch Between Versions

To compare dependencies across versions:

1. Use the **Branch/Tag Selector** at the top
2. Select a different version
3. The graph updates to show that version's dependencies

This helps identify:
- Which versions have more vulnerabilities
- When dependencies were added or removed
- How dependency risk evolves over time

## Understand Node Colors

Dependency graph node colors represent vulnerability risk:

- **Green**: Safe (no vulnerabilities)
- **Yellow**: Low/Medium risk
- **Orange**: High risk
- **Red**: Critical risk
- **Blue/Green**: Base image components (if using VEX/SBOM data)

The color is calculated from the highest severity vulnerability in that component and inherited risk from its dependencies.

## Best Practices

### Regular Review
- Review your dependency graph monthly
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in existing components
- Track when high-risk dependencies are added

### Understand Your Supply Chain
- Know what direct dependencies you have
- Be aware of significant transitive dependencies
- Identify bottleneck packages that many things depend on

### Risk Assessment
- Prioritize fixing vulnerabilities in heavily-used components
- Transitive dependencies are harder to fix—update parents instead
- Consider dependency alternatives if risks are too high

### Version Management
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Avoid version conflicts (same package at different versions)
- Pin versions to ensure reproducible builds

## Troubleshooting

### Graph is Very Large

- Filter to a specific artifact
- Turn off "Display all dependencies"
- Search for specific components instead

### Can't See Vulnerable Components

1. Ensure "Display all dependencies" is off
2. Check if the artifact filter is too restrictive
3. Run a new scan if data is outdated
4. Verify vulnerabilities are detected (check Vulnerabilities section)

### Missing Dependencies

1. Ensure the artifact selector matches your build
2. Verify SBOM was generated correctly
3. Check if you need to upload a manual SBOM for missing artifacts
4. Some package managers may not have complete dependency information

### Performance Issues

- Use artifact filtering to reduce graph size
- Switch to smaller versions
- Close the fullscreen view
- Refresh the page if it feels sluggish
