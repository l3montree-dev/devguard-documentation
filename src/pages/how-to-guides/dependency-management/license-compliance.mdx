# Manage License Compliance

Monitor component licenses in your dependencies and ensure they comply with your organization's licensing policies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard project and repository
- A completed dependency scan (SCA scan) or uploaded SBOM
- Licensing policies defined for your organization (e.g., OSI-approved licenses only)

## Open License Risk Management

Navigate to the license compliance interface:

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Repository** → **License Compliance**
2. You'll see a list of components with problematic licenses
3. Each row shows the component name, detected license, and remediation status

## Understanding License Risks

DevGuard identifies license risks when:

- **No license detected** - Component has no declared license
- **Non-OSI approved** - License isn't in the Open Source Initiative approved list
- **Proprietary license** - License is proprietary or incompatible with open source projects
- **Undeclared license** - License information is missing from package metadata

<Callout type="info">
    OSI-approved licenses include Apache 2.0, MIT, GPL 3.0, BSD variants, and
    many others. See [opensource.org/licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)
    for the complete list.
</Callout>

## Filter by Status

View license risks in different states:

1. Use the **State Filter** tabs:
    - **Open** - Unresolved license issues
    - **Resolved** - Issues you've addressed (accepted, overridden, or components removed)

2. Click the tab to filter the list

## Search and Find Licenses

Locate specific components or licenses:

1. Use the **search box** to find by:
    - Component name (e.g., "react")
    - Component version (e.g., "18.2.0")
    - License type (e.g., "GPL", "Apache")

The search matches partial text and is case-insensitive.

**Search examples:**

```
- "react" → Finds React-related license issues
- "GPL" → Shows all GPL-licensed components
- "@angular" → Finds Angular framework components
```

## View License Details

Click on a component to see complete license information:

1. Click a row in the license risks list
2. View the detected license and component information
3. See which artifacts contain this component
4. Check the audit trail of decisions made

## Filter by Artifact

Show licenses from specific build artifacts:

1. Use the **Artifact Selector** dropdown
2. Select the artifact (container image, application build)
3. List updates to show only that artifact's licenses

## Make License Decisions

For each problematic license, choose how to handle it:

### Accept the License Risk

If you decide to use the component despite the licensing concerns:

1. Click on the license risk
2. Click **Accept License Risk**
3. Provide justification (required for compliance audit)
4. Optionally add a comment
5. The risk moves to "Resolved" status

### Override with Different License

If the detected license is incorrect:

1. Click on the component/license combination
2. Select **Override License Decision**
3. Choose the correct license from the approved list
4. Confirm the change
5. The component is marked as resolved with the correct license

<Callout type="warning">
    Only override licenses if you're certain the auto-detection was incorrect.
    Verify against the package's official repository or LICENSE file.
</Callout>

### Remove Component

If you decide not to use this component:

1. Remove the dependency from your code
2. Run a new scan to detect the change
3. The license risk automatically disappears from the open list

## License Decision Audit Trail

Track all license decisions for compliance:

1. Click on any resolved license issue
2. View the complete history showing:
    - Who made the decision
    - When the decision was made
    - What was decided
    - Justification provided
    - Any comments or notes

This audit trail is essential for compliance frameworks like ISO 27001 and CRA.

## Monitor License Distribution

Understand your overall license compliance:

1. Navigate to **Dependencies** section
2. View the **License Distribution** chart showing:
    - How many components use each license
    - Percentage of OSI-approved vs. non-approved licenses
    - License breakdown by category

**Key metrics:**

- **OSI-Approved Licenses**: Safe for most projects
- **Copyleft Licenses** (GPL): Require source code disclosure
- **Proprietary Licenses**: Check compatibility with your business model

## Compliance Frameworks

License compliance supports these standards:

- **OSI Open Source Definition** - Uses official approved licenses list
- **ISO 27001** - Tracks license decisions for audit
- **CRA (Cyber Resilience Act)** - Documents license management process
- **SBOM/VEX** - Exports include license information

## Export License Data

Download license information for reporting:

1. Click **Download SBOM** to export components with licenses
2. The SBOM includes:
    - All component names and versions
    - Detected or overridden licenses
    - License status (approved/non-approved)
3. Share with legal or compliance teams

## Troubleshooting

### "No license detected" for a component

- Component metadata may not include license information
- Check the package's official repository
- Override with the correct license manually
- Consider contributing the license to the package

### Can't find a specific license in the dropdown

- DevGuard uses the OSI-approved licenses list
- If your license isn't in the list, it's likely not OSI-approved
- Consider choosing the closest compatible license
- Or contact your DevGuard administrator to add it

### License decision not saving

- Verify you have the correct permissions (project admin or owner)
- Check your internet connection
- Try again or contact support if the issue persists

## Next Steps

- [Override License Decisions](./override-license-decisions.mdx) - Change detected licenses
- [Find Vulnerable Dependencies](./find-vulnerable-deps.mdx) - Check security alongside licenses
- [Generate VEX Documents](/how-to-guides/compliance/generate-vex-documents.mdx) - Include license decisions in VEX
