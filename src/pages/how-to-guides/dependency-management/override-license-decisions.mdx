# Override License Decisions

Manually set or correct the license assigned to components when auto-detection is incorrect or needs updating.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A repository with license risks identified
- Project admin or owner permissions
- Knowledge of the correct license for the component (verify from official source)

## Why Override a License

You might override a license when:

- **Auto-detection failed** - No license was detected but the component has one
- **Wrong license detected** - The tool detected the wrong license
- **Multiple licenses** - The component has multiple licenses and you want to specify which applies
- **Updated package** - The component's license changed in a newer version
- **Business decision** - You've made a deliberate choice to use a different license

## Access License Override Interface

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Repository** → **License Compliance**
2. Find the component with the license you want to override
3. Click on the component row to view details

## Select Correct License

In the license details view:

1. Look for the **"Corrected to License"** field
2. If it shows "Not yet corrected", click to edit
3. A dropdown appears with approved licenses

**Available license categories:**

<Tabs items={['Permissive', 'Copyleft', 'Proprietary', 'Other']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Permissive Licenses** - Allow commercial use with attribution
    
    - Apache-2.0 - Widely used, business-friendly
    - MIT - Simple, minimal restrictions
    - BSD 2-Clause, BSD 3-Clause - Flexible, attribution required
    - ISC - Similar to MIT
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Copyleft Licenses** - Require sharing of modifications
    
    - GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0 - Strong copyleft, code must be shared
    - LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0 - Weak copyleft, linking allowed
    - AGPL-3.0 - Network copyleft, covers distributed services
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Proprietary/Restricted**
    
    - Business Source License (BSL)
    - Evaluation licenses
    - Custom proprietary licenses
    - Non-commercial only licenses
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Other**
    
    - Dual/Multi-licensing
    - License expressions (e.g., "MIT OR Apache-2.0")
    - Unknown or non-standard licenses
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  Unsure which license applies? Check the component's official repository, LICENSE file, or package metadata on the registry (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.).
</Callout>

## Override Steps

1. **Click the component** in the license risks list
2. **Review current license** shown in the risk details
3. **Select new license** from the approved licenses dropdown
4. **Provide justification** - Required field:
   - Why you're overriding (e.g., "Verified as MIT from package.json")
   - Business context (e.g., "Accepted due to component criticality")
5. **Optionally add comment** for additional context
6. **Confirm** the override

The decision is immediately recorded and the component moves to "Resolved" status.

## License Override Examples

### Example 1: Auto-detection missed the license
**Scenario**: React library shows "no license detected"

1. Open the React component in License Compliance
2. Check the official React repository → MIT license confirmed
3. Select "MIT" from dropdown
4. Justification: "Verified as MIT from React GitHub repository"
5. Confirm override

### Example 2: Dual-licensed component
**Scenario**: Component can be used under GPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0

1. Open the component
2. Review both licenses available
3. Select "Apache-2.0" (your organization prefers permissive)
4. Justification: "Dual-licensed; selected Apache-2.0 per organizational policy"
5. Confirm

### Example 3: Custom license discovered
**Scenario**: Internal component with custom license

1. Open the component
2. If your custom license isn't in the dropdown, contact your administrator
3. Alternatively, select closest matching OSI-approved license
4. Justification: "Internal component; mapped to [license type] for compliance purposes"
5. Confirm

## Bulk Override Operations

For multiple components with the same issue:

1. **Identify the pattern** - All components with same problem (e.g., all missing licenses)
2. **Contact administrator** for bulk operations
3. DevGuard admin can apply the same decision to multiple components
4. Each decision is tracked separately for audit purposes

## View Override History

To see all license override decisions:

1. Go to **License Compliance** view
2. Look for resolved issues (click **Resolved** tab)
3. Click on any resolved license issue
4. View the **Decision History** showing:
   - Original detected license
   - Overridden to license
   - Who made the decision
   - When it was made
   - Justification provided
   - Any comments

## Correct or Update Overrides

If you need to change a previous override:

1. Navigate to the resolved license issue
2. Click **Modify Decision**
3. Select new license (or revert to original)
4. Provide reason for the change
5. Confirm update

The old decision is preserved in audit trail, and the new decision becomes active.

## Impact on Compliance Reports

License overrides affect:

- **SBOM exports** - Include the overridden license
- **Compliance dashboards** - Show corrected license status
- **Audit reports** - Document all decisions with justification
- **VEX documents** - Include license exceptions

## Revert an Override

To go back to original auto-detected license:

1. Open the overridden license
2. Click **Revert Override**
3. Provide reason (e.g., "Auto-detection now correct in newer version")
4. Confirm reversion

The original license becomes active again, but the override history remains for audit purposes.

## Validate Your Overrides

Best practices for accuracy:

1. **Always verify** against official sources
2. **Document your source** in justification field
3. **Review regularly** - Licenses can change between versions
4. **Team review** - Have another team member confirm important decisions
5. **Audit trail** - Keep detailed justifications for compliance audits

<Callout type="warning">
  Incorrect license assignments can create legal risks. Always verify licenses against the official package source before overriding.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Guessing licenses** - Always verify from official source
- **Not documenting** - Always provide clear justification
- **Ignoring copyleft** - GPL licenses require special handling
- **Forgetting to override** - Both direct and transitive dependencies need review
- **Manual overrides forever** - Monitor for fixes in package metadata
