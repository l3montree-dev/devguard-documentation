# Find Vulnerable Dependencies

Locate and analyze dependencies with security vulnerabilities in your repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard project and repository
- A completed dependency scan (SCA scan) or uploaded SBOM
- At least one known vulnerable dependency in your repository

## Open the Dependency Risks View

Navigate to the vulnerability search and filtering interface:

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Repository** → **Risk Handling**
2. You'll see a list of all packages with identified vulnerabilities
3. Each row shows a package name and the vulnerabilities affecting it

## Filter by Artifact

If your repository contains multiple build artifacts or scanning sources, filter by specific artifacts:

1. Use the **Artifact Selector** dropdown at the top of the page
2. Select the artifact (e.g., specific container image, application build)
3. The vulnerability list updates to show only vulnerabilities in the selected artifact

<Callout type="info">
  Artifacts are automatically detected from your SBOM. If you don't see expected artifacts, verify your scan included them.
</Callout>

## View Vulnerability Status

Show vulnerabilities in different states:

1. Use the **State Filter** tabs:
   - **Open** - Unresolved vulnerabilities requiring action
   - **Resolved** - Vulnerabilities you've handled (false positives, accepted risks, fixed)

2. Click the tab to filter the list

**Understanding states:**
- **Open**: Detected vulnerability not yet addressed
- **Resolved**: You've created an event (accepted, false positive, or fixed)

## Search for Vulnerabilities

Find specific vulnerabilities using multiple search methods:

1. **By CVE ID**: Search for `CVE-2024-1234` to find exact vulnerability
2. **By Component Name**: Search for `react`, `log4j`, etc. to find packages
3. **By Description**: Search for keywords like `buffer overflow`, `SQL injection`

The search is case-insensitive and matches partial text:

```
Search Examples:
- "CVE-2024" → Finds all CVEs from 2024
- "spring" → Finds all Spring framework vulnerabilities
- "remote code" → Finds all RCE vulnerabilities
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The search requires at least 3 characters to avoid too many results. Shorter searches are ignored.
</Callout>

## Analyze Package Vulnerabilities

Click on any package row to see detailed vulnerability information:

1. Click a package name (e.g., "react@18.2.0")
2. View all CVEs affecting that package with:
   - **CVE ID** - Official vulnerability identifier
   - **Severity** - CVSS score and severity badge (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - **Risk Score** - DevGuard's calculated risk considering CIA requirements
   - **Description** - What the vulnerability affects
   - **Exploits** - Known public exploits (if available)
   - **Fixed in** - Recommended version to upgrade to

### View Fix Recommendations

For each vulnerability:

1. Check the **"Fixed in Version"** column
2. This shows the minimum version that fixes the issue
3. Upgrade your dependency to at least this version

**Example**: If react@18.2.0 has CVE-2024-1234 fixed in 18.3.0, upgrade to 18.3.0 or later.

## Filter by Severity and Risk

Use advanced filtering to focus on the most critical vulnerabilities:

### By Severity Level
- **Critical** - Highest priority, immediate action needed
- **High** - Important security issues to address soon
- **Medium** - Should be reviewed and prioritized
- **Low** - Informational, lower priority

### By Risk Score
The DevGuard risk score considers:
- **CVSS Score** - Industry vulnerability severity
- **Exploitability** - Availability of known exploits
- **CIA Requirements** - Your asset's confidentiality, integrity, availability needs
- **Impact Context** - Whether the vulnerable code is actually used

**Higher risk scores** mean the vulnerability is more likely to impact your application.

## Identify High-Risk Components

The vulnerability list is ordered by risk score by default. The most critical vulnerabilities appear first.

**Quick wins:**
1. Look for multiple vulnerabilities in the same package
2. Focus on packages with critical or high severity scores
3. Prioritize packages with available exploits
4. Check if the vulnerable code path is actually used in your application

## Create Events to Track Remediation

Once you've reviewed a vulnerability, document your decision:

1. Click on a vulnerability row
2. Choose one of these actions:
   - **Accept Risk** - You accept the security risk and won't fix immediately
   - **Mark as False Positive** - The vulnerability doesn't apply to your situation
   - **Mitigate** - You've implemented a workaround
   - **Add Comment** - Document investigation or remediation progress

<Callout type="info">
  Creating events doesn't fix the vulnerability—it tracks your organization's response for compliance and audit purposes.
</Callout>

## Version Comparison and Upgrade Planning

Plan your upgrades using DevGuard's risk reduction analysis:

1. Hover over a package name to see available upgrade versions
2. Each version shows:
   - **Risk reduction** - How much total risk is eliminated by upgrading
   - **Remaining vulnerabilities** - CVEs that still affect the new version
3. Choose the version that balances risk reduction with compatibility

**Example**: If upgrading from react@18.2.0 to 18.3.0 reduces risk by 42%, you can see the exact vulnerabilities that would be fixed.

## Export Results

Download vulnerability data for reports or external tools:

1. Click **Download SBOM** to export your component inventory
2. Click **Download VEX** to export vulnerability exceptions document
3. Share with security teams, compliance, or incident response

## Troubleshooting

### No vulnerabilities found
- Your dependencies may have no known vulnerabilities ✓
- Verify your scan completed: Check **Scan History** tab
- Ensure your SBOM includes all actual dependencies

### Missing expected vulnerabilities
- The vulnerability database may not include your ecosystem
- Some ecosystems (like private registries) aren't covered
- Check if the package was actually included in your scan

### Cannot search for a specific CVE
- The CVE may not be in the DevGuard vulnerability database yet
- Search by component name instead
- Check external sources like CVE Details or NVD for confirmation
