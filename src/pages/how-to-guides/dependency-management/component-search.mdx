# Search for Components

Discover which repositories contain specific components and analyze their impact across your organization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard organization
- At least one repository with completed dependency scans
- Component information indexed (automatic after scans)

## Find Components Across Organization

Search for a component across all your repositories:

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Search**
2. Enter component details in search box
3. View results showing all repositories using this component

**Search by:**
- Component name (e.g., "react", "log4j")
- Component version (e.g., "18.2.0")
- Package ecosystem (e.g., "npm", "pip", "maven")
- PURL format (e.g., "pkg:npm/react@18.2.0")

## View Component Details

Click on a component in search results to see:

- **Component name and version**
- **Repository using it** - Which repositories have this component
- **Direct vs. transitive** - Is it directly required or a dependency of a dependency?
- **Artifacts** - Which build outputs contain it
- **License** - Declared license or "unknown"
- **Security status** - Known vulnerabilities affecting this version
- **Supply chain info** - Open-source project details if available

## Filter by Component Ecosystem

Narrow search results by package ecosystem:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'PyPI', 'Maven', 'Go', 'Other']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **npm** - JavaScript/Node.js packages
    
    Format: `pkg:npm/package-name@version`
    
    Example: Search for "react" to find all React versions
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **PyPI** - Python packages
    
    Format: `pkg:pypi/package-name@version`
    
    Example: Search for "django" for all Django installations
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Maven** - Java packages
    
    Format: `pkg:maven/group/artifact@version`
    
    Example: Search for "log4j" for Java logging vulnerabilities
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Go** - Go modules
    
    Format: `pkg:golang/module/name@version`
    
    Example: Search for "gorm" for Go ORM usage
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Other ecosystems** - Conan, Nuget, Composer, etc.
    
    Use PURL format for precise searches
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Identify Component Vulnerabilities

When searching for a component, also see:

- **Vulnerabilities affecting any version** - Known CVEs
- **Fixed in version** - Minimum version that patches issues
- **Severity distribution** - Count of critical, high, medium, low issues
- **Exploits available** - Public exploits if any exist

**Risk assessment:**
```
If searching for "react" and version 18.2.0 has CVE-2024-1234:
1. See which repositories use 18.2.0
2. Check if any versions are patched
3. Identify repositories needing updates
```

## Track Component Usage Across Repositories

Understand component distribution:

1. Search for a component
2. View all repositories using it
3. See version breakdown:
   - How many repos use v1.0.0?
   - How many use v2.0.0?
   - How many use vulnerable versions?

This helps identify standardization opportunities or risks.

## Find Transitive Dependencies

Components are not just direct dependencies:

1. Search for a component
2. See **Direct** dependencies (explicitly required)
3. See **Transitive** dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)
4. Identify if component appears as transitive in many repos

<Callout type="info">
  Transitive dependencies are harder to control. Finding them helps with supply chain security analysis.
</Callout>

## Analyze Component with Known Vulnerabilities

When searching for components with CVEs:

1. Enter the component name
2. View **All versions** and their CVE status
3. Identify affected versions across your repos
4. Plan remediation:
   - Which repos need updates?
   - Which versions are safe?
   - What's the upgrade path?

**Example: Log4j2 vulnerability**
```
Search: "log4j"
Results show:
- v2.17.0 and earlier: Vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 (Critical)
- v2.17.1+: Patched
- Your repos status:
  - Production app: v2.16.0 (vulnerable!)
  - Tools repo: v2.17.2 (safe)
  - Legacy service: v2.14.0 (vulnerable!)
```

## View Component Project Information

For open-source components, see:

- **Project homepage** - Link to official repository
- **License** - Declared license
- **Open-source status** - Link to OpenSSF Project if available
- **Download statistics** - Popularity in the ecosystem
- **Last release date** - Activity level
- **Maintainer info** - Who maintains it

<Callout type="info">
  Unmaintained or rarely-updated components may be riskier than actively maintained alternatives.
</Callout>

## Create Incidents from Component Search

If you find a high-risk component:

1. Search for it
2. Click **Create Incident** or **Create Issue**
3. DevGuard creates a tracking item for all affected repositories
4. Team can collaborate on remediation plan
5. Progress is tracked across organization

## Export Component Report

Generate reports on component usage:

1. Perform component search
2. Click **Export Results**
3. Download data including:
   - All repositories using component
   - Versions in each repository
   - Vulnerability status
   - License information
4. Share with security team or stakeholders

## Monitor Component Lifecycle

Track when components change:

- **New occurrences** - Component added to new repository
- **Version updates** - Repository upgraded component version
- **Removal** - Repository no longer uses component
- **Vulnerability discovery** - New CVE published for version

Set up alerts to track important components.

## Component Search Examples

### Finding and replacing outdated dependencies
```
Search: "lodash@4.17.0"
Result: 12 repos using this version
Action: Creates upgrade plan to latest safe version
```

### Identifying supply chain risk
```
Search: "tiny-cookie@0.1.0"
Result: Unknown project, no maintainer activity for 3 years
Decision: Consider replacing with maintained alternative
```

### Tracking vulnerable components
```
Search: "react@16.x"
Result: 5 repos still using vulnerable React 16
Action: Plan upgrades to React 18+ LTS
```

### License compliance across org
```
Search: "gcc" (ecosystem: Go)
Result: Found in 8 repos, all GPL-licensed
Decision: Evaluate implications or replace
```

## Best Practices

1. **Search regularly** - Monitor critical components monthly
2. **Keep updated** - Upgrade to latest safe versions quickly
3. **Standardize versions** - Use same versions across similar projects when possible
4. **Review transitive deps** - Check indirect dependencies for risks
5. **Document decisions** - Record why you chose specific versions
6. **Automate where possible** - Use Dependabot or similar for updates

## Troubleshooting

### Component not found in search
- Verify the exact name and spelling
- Try PURL format: `pkg:ecosystem/name@version`
- Check if repository has been scanned recently
- Ensure you have access to repositories

### Too many search results
- Be more specific with version or ecosystem
- Filter by repository if searching organization-wide
- Use PURL format for precise matching

### Version information seems outdated
- Trigger a new scan: Go to repository → **Rescan Now**
- Check when this repository was last scanned
- Results update after new scan completes
