# Generate CSAF Reports

Generate CSAF (Common Security Advisory Framework) reports to document and distribute vulnerability information in a standardized format.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard repository with detected vulnerabilities
- Project admin or owner permissions
- At least one vulnerability to report on
- Knowledge about CSAF format



## Access CSAF Reports

CSAF reports are automatically generated on-demand by DevGuard:

### Enable Public Access

Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Repository** → **Settings** 

**Enable the toggle for public access to vulnerability data:**
![Enable Public Access to Vulnerability Data](../../../assets/share-vex.png)

This will allow external parties to access vulnerability data for this repository and how vulnerabilities are assessed, improving transparency in your supply chain.

## Next Steps

- [Generate VEX Documents](./generate-vex-documents.mdx) - Export vulnerability exceptions
- [Export SBOM](./export-sbom.mdx) - Download component inventory
- [View Compliance Dashboards](./compliance-dashboards.mdx) - Monitor all vulnerabilities
