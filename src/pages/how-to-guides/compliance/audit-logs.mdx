# View Audit Logs

Access and review comprehensive audit logs of all security decisions, compliance actions, and system changes for regulatory compliance and forensic investigation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to a DevGuard organization
- Audit log viewing permissions (typically admin or owner)
- At least one scan or security event completed

## What Are Audit Logs?

Audit logs track:

- **Security decisions** - When vulnerabilities were marked false positive, accepted, etc.
- **Compliance actions** - Policy changes, license overrides, compliance reviews
- **User actions** - Who made what changes and when
- **System events** - Scans completed, attestations received, policies evaluated
- **Timestamps** - Exact time of each action
- **Justifications** - Reasoning provided for decisions

<Callout type="info">
  Comprehensive audit trails are essential for compliance frameworks like ISO 27001, SOC 2, CRA, and others. They demonstrate your organization's security practices to auditors.

## Navigate to Audit Logs

Access audit logs at different levels:

### Organization-Level Audit Logs

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Settings** → **Audit Logs**
2. View all actions across organization
3. Filter by date range, user, action type
4. Export for compliance documentation

### Project-Level Audit Logs

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Settings** → **Audit Logs**
2. View actions specific to this project
3. Filter by repository, user, date

### Repository-Level Audit Logs

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Project** → **Repository** → **History** or **Audit**
2. View actions specific to this repository
3. Most detailed view of security decisions

## Understanding Audit Log Entries

Each audit log entry contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | Exact date and time of action |
| **User** | Who performed the action |
| **Action** | What happened (e.g., "Vulnerability marked false positive") |
| **Resource** | What was affected (e.g., CVE ID, component name) |
| **Details** | Additional context and justification |
| **Change** | What changed (before/after) |
| **IP Address** | Source IP (for security investigation) |

## Filter and Search Audit Logs

Find specific events quickly:

    - Vulnerability marked false positive
    - Vulnerability accepted (risk)
    - Vulnerability reopened
    - Vulnerability fixed
    - Mitigations added
    - Comments created
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    License compliance actions:
    - License marked as accepted
    - License decision overridden
    - License risk created/resolved
    - License decision updated
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Policy and compliance actions:
    - Policy created/modified
    - Policy enabled/disabled
    - Compliance controls reviewed
    - Attestations uploaded
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    User and access actions:
    - User added/removed
    - Permissions changed
    - Access tokens created
    - Settings modified
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Search Features

1. **By date range** - Filter to specific time period
2. **By user** - See what specific person did
3. **By resource** - Find all actions on a CVE or component
4. **By action** - Find all "vulnerability accepted" events
5. **By status** - Filter by success/failure
6. **Full text search** - Search justification text

Example searches:
```
- User: "john@company.com" → All actions by John
- Action: "false positive" → All false positive decisions
- Date: "2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31" → January actions
- Resource: "CVE-2024-1234" → All actions on this CVE
```

## Examine Detailed Event Information

View complete details of any audit event:

1. Click on an audit log entry
2. View complete details including:
   - **Full justification** - Complete reasoning provided
   - **Comments** - Discussion or additional context
   - **Related events** - Linked actions (e.g., if reopening, shows original closure)
   - **Approval history** - If approval was required
   - **Attachments** - Any documents referenced


## Compliance-Required Audit Trail

Maintain records for compliance:

### Actions That Create Audit Entries

**Must be documented:**
1. ✓ Every vulnerability decision (accepted, false positive, etc.)
2. ✓ License overrides and decisions
3. ✓ Compliance policy changes
4. ✓ Security personnel actions
5. ✓ Access control changes

**Best practices:**
- Always provide justification when creating events
- Document business reasons for security decisions
- Get peer review for significant decisions
- Keep audit logs for compliance period (typically 1+ years)

### Exporting for Compliance

Download audit logs for auditor review:

1. Navigate to **Audit Logs**
2. Select date range and filters
3. Click **Export**
4. Choose format:
   - **CSV** - For spreadsheet analysis
   - **JSON** - For system import
   - **PDF** - For documentation
5. Download file

Use for:
- Annual compliance audits
- Incident investigations
- Regulatory submissions
- SOC 2 Type II reports

## Investigate Security Incidents

Use audit logs for forensic investigation:

1. **Identify the incident** - Note date/time and affected resource
2. **Search audit logs** - Filter to relevant date range
3. **Trace timeline** - See all actions before/after incident
4. **Identify users** - Who had access and made changes
5. **Review justifications** - Understand reasoning
6. **Document findings** - Export logs as evidence

Example investigation:
```
Incident: Unexpected vulnerability marked as false positive
1. Search: CVE-X, date range, user "unknown"
2. Find: Marked by automated process (DevGuard scanner)
3. Review: Scanner had different risk assessment logic
4. Resolution: Policy was updated, vulnerability re-evaluated
```

## Archive and Retention

Manage audit log retention:

### Storage

- **Online storage** - Last 90 days (always accessible)
- **Archive storage** - Older logs (searchable, slower access)
- **Backup** - Encrypted backup for compliance

### Retention Policies

Configure how long to keep logs:

1. Go to **Organization** → **Settings** → **Audit Retention**
2. Set retention period (minimum 1 year recommended)
3. Choose archival strategy
4. Configure backup frequency

Compliance recommendations:
- **ISO 27001** - Keep 1 year minimum
- **SOC 2** - Keep 2 years minimum
- **CRA** - Keep per regulation (check local rules)
- **GDPR** - Keep per data protection requirements

## Real-Time Audit Monitoring

Monitor for unusual activity:

### Set Up Alerts

1. Go to **Organization** → **Settings** → **Audit Alerts**
2. Configure notifications for:
   - Mass false positive marking (potential abuse)
   - Unusual user access patterns
   - Policy changes
   - Bulk license overrides
   - Unauthorized access attempts

3. Choose notification method (email, Slack, webhook)

### Review Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Organization** → **Dashboard**
2. View **Recent Audit Activity** widget
3. See:
   - Last 10 actions
   - Users most active
   - Most changed resources
   - Anomalies detected

## Audit Log Best Practices

1. **Always provide context** - When making decisions, explain why
2. **Review decisions** - Have second person review major decisions
3. **Export regularly** - Keep compliance-ready exports available
4. **Monitor alerts** - Check for unusual patterns
5. **Archive properly** - Retain logs per compliance requirements
6. **Redact if needed** - Remove sensitive information before sharing
7. **Document investigation** - If issues found, document remediation

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot access audit logs
- Verify you have audit log viewing permissions
- Check organization-level permissions
- Contact administrator if needed

### Logs not showing recent events
- Events may take minutes to appear
- Refresh the page
- Check filters aren't hiding results

### Cannot export large date ranges
- Large exports take time
- Try smaller date ranges
- Contact support for bulk export

### Justification text is incomplete
- Click entry to view full details
- Check original decision location
- Comments may be in related entry
