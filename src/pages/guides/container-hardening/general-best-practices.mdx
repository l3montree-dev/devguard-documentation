# General Best Practices for Image Hardening

> We recommend using [distroless images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) whenever possible. If you need a shell or interactive capabilities, use minimal base images like Alpine or Debian Slim.

- Always use **minimal base images** and prefer **distroless** if possible.  
- Remove **unnecessary packages, tools, and shells** to reduce the attack surface.  
- Run containers as a **non-root user**.  
- Use **read-only file systems** and restrict Linux capabilities to the minimum required.  

We provide a small [Container Hardening Workbench Project](https://gitlab.opencode.de/l3montree/container-hardening-work-bench) 
that you can use to experiment with different hardening techniques and see their effects on vulnerability count.

Another nice resource are the US Department of Defense's [Iron Bank Container Images](https://repo1.dso.mil/dsop) as well 
as the [Slim-Toolkit project](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim).
