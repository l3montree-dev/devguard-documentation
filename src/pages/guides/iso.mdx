| [A.8.26 Application security requirements ](#a826-application-security-requirements) | ðŸ”µ | The measure requires that information security requirements are identified, specified and approved during the development or procurement of applications to ensure their consideration throughout the process.|
| [A.8.28 Secure Coding ](#a828-secure-coding)                       | âœ…  | The measure requires the application of the principles of secure coding in software development to ensure the security of the software and minimize potential security vulnerabilities.|
| [A.8.29 Security Testing in Development and Acceptance](#a829-security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance) | âœ…  | The measure requires the definition and integration of security testing procedures into the development lifecycle to ensure that information security requirements are met when applications or code are deployed in the production environment.|
| [A.8.30 Outsourced Development](#a830-outsourced-development)      |  ðŸ”µ  | The measure requires the organization to manage, monitor and review the activities of outsourced system development to ensure that the required information security measures are implemented.|



## How DevGuard helps you with the ISO 27001 compliance



### âœ… DevGuard covers your controls through the following features:

<details>
<summary>

#### A.8.8 Management of Technical Vulnerabilities

</summary>


- Identification and documentation of vulnerabilities in your codebase through static code analysis and dynamic code analysis.  
- Identification and documentation of software components and libraries in your codebase through SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation, listing all software components with their versions.  
- Automatic generation and documentation of an SBOM with versions for each new change in the codebase.  
- Identification and documentation of vulnerabilities in the dependencies of your codebase through dependency scanning. This includes detecting known vulnerabilities in databases such as NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and GitHub repositories.  
- Verification of available patches for the vulnerabilities in dependencies, along with guidance on how to apply them.  
- Prioritization of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies, enabling you to address the most critical issues first.  
- Continuous monitoring of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies to track whether they have been resolved.
- Documentation of the vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies, and the fixes applied to address them.
</details>




<details>
<summary>

#### A.8.25 Secure Development Life Cycle

</summary>

- The pipeline is designed to be secure by default, adhering to best practices outlined by OWASP.  
- Monitoring the software development lifecycle by displaying which threats are mitigated and which are not, based on SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Model.
- Ensuring the integrity of the codebase and protecting it from unauthorized changes through in-toto.  

</details>






<details>
<summary>

#### A.8.28 Secure Coding

</summary>

- Identification and documentation of secrets and credentials in your codebase through secret scanning.  
- Identification and documentation of software components and libraries in your codebase through SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation, listing all software components with their versions.  
- Automatic generation and documentation of an SBOM with versions for each new change in the codebase.  
- Identification and documentation of vulnerabilities in the dependencies of your codebase through dependency scanning. This includes detecting known vulnerabilities in databases such as NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and GitHub repositories.  
- Calculation and documentation of the risk of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies through risk analysis.  
- Ensuring the integrity of the codebase and protection from unauthorized changes through in-toto.  
- Prioritization of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies, enabling you to address the most critical issues first.  
- Identification and documentation of licenses in your codebase through license scanning.  

</details>






<details>
<summary>

#### A.8.29 Security Testing in Development and Acceptance

</summary>

- The requirements for information securityâ€”integrity, availability, and confidentialityâ€”can be customized. Based on these requirements, the risks of vulnerabilities are calculated and documented through risk analysis.  
- Adherence to secure coding principles. See [A.8.28 Secure Coding](#a828-secure-coding).
