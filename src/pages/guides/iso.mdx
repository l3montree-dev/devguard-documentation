## How DevGuard helps you with the ISO 27001 compliance



### ✅ DevGuard covers your controls through the following features

<details>
<summary>

<h4> A.8.8 Management of Technical Vulnerabilities </h4>

</summary>

- Identification and documentation of vulnerabilities in your codebase through [static code analysis](../concepts/devsecops/sast.mdx) and [dynamic code analysis](../concepts/devsecops/dast.mdx).  
- Identification and documentation of software components and libraries in your codebase through [SBOM](../concepts#sbom) (Software Bill of Materials) generation, listing all software components with their versions.  
- Automatic generation and documentation of an [SBOM](../concepts#sbom) (Software Bill of Materials) with versions for each new change in the codebase.  
- Identification and documentation of vulnerabilities in the dependencies of your codebase through dependency scanning with [software composition analysis](../concepts/devsecops/software-composition-analysis.mdx) (SCA) and [container images](../concepts/devsecops/container-scanning.mdx).  
- Verification of available patches for the vulnerabilities in dependencies, along with guidance on how to apply them.  
- Calculation and documentation of the risk of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies through [risk analysis](./mangeRisks.mdx).  
- Prioritization of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies, enabling you to address the most critical issues first.  
- Continuous monitoring of vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies to track whether they have been resolved.  
- Documentation of the vulnerabilities in your codebase and dependencies, along with the fixes applied to address them.

<h4> A.8.25 Secure Development Life Cycle </h4>

</summary>

- The pipeline is designed to be secure by default, adhering to best practices outlined by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-risksMtigation-guideline/) DevSecOps Guideline.
- Monitoring the software development lifecycle by displaying which threats are mitigated and which are not, based on [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats)(Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Model.
- Ensuring the integrity of the codebase and protecting it from unauthorized changes through in-toto.
