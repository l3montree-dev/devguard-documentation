# Your First Scan

This guide walks you through running a dependency scan (SCA) on your project using the DevGuard scanner and viewing the results in the DevGuard UI. It takes about 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker** installed on your system
- Access to a **DevGuard instance** ([DevGuard Cloud](https://app.devguard.org) or [self-hosted](/how-to-guides/administration))
- A **repository** created in DevGuard (organization → group → repository)

If you need to set up a local instance from scratch, follow the [Quickstart](/getting-started) instead.

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create a Personal Access Token

The scanner authenticates with DevGuard using a personal access token (PAT).

1. Log into your DevGuard instance
2. Navigate to **User Settings** (click your avatar → Settings)
3. Under **Personal Access Tokens**, click **Create Token**
4. Give the token a descriptive name (e.g., "CLI Scanner")
5. Copy the generated token — you won't be able to see it again

<Callout type="warning">
  Store your token securely. Never commit it to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in CI/CD pipelines.
</Callout>

### Identify Your Asset Name

Every scan targets a specific repository (called an **asset**) in DevGuard. The asset name follows this pattern:

```
{org}/{projects}/{project}/{assets}/{repository}
```

You can copy the full asset name from the URL when viewing your repository in the DevGuard UI. For example, if your URL is:

```
https://app.devguard.org/myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo
```

Then your asset name is `myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo`.

### Run the Dependency Scan

Navigate to the root of your project directory and run:

```bash copy
docker run -v "$(pwd):/app" ghcr.io/l3montree-dev/devguard/scanner:main-latest \
  devguard-scanner sca \
    --path /app/ \
    --assetName="myorg/projects/myproject/assets/myrepo" \
    --apiUrl="https://api.devguard.org" \
    --token="YOUR_TOKEN"
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Self-hosted?** Replace `--apiUrl` with the URL of your DevGuard API (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
</Callout>

The scanner will:
1. Detect your project's package manager and parse dependency files
2. Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
3. Upload the SBOM to DevGuard
4. Match all components against the vulnerability database
5. Print a summary of findings to your terminal

### Review the Terminal Output

A successful scan produces a table like this:

```

+--------------------------------------------+----------------+------+------+---------------------+---------+--------+
| LIBRARY                                    | VULNERABILITY  | RISK | CVSS | INSTALLED           | FIXED   | STATUS |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------+------+------+---------------------+---------+--------+
| pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto             | CVE-2025-47914 | 0.49 |  5.3 | 0.44.0              | v0.45.0 | open   |
| pkg:golang/github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go | CVE-2025-63811 | 0.57 |  7.5 | 1.6.0               | v1.7.0  | open   |

```

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **LIBRARY** | The affected package in [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) format |
| **VULNERABILITY** | CVE or advisory identifier |
| **RISK** | DevGuard's contextual [risk score](/explanations/core-concepts/risk-scoring) — factors in exploitability, known exploits, and dependency depth |
| **CVSS** | Raw CVSS severity score |
| **INSTALLED** | The version currently in your project |
| **FIXED** | The version that resolves the vulnerability (empty if no fix is available) |
| **STATUS** | Current vulnerability status (`open`, `fixed`, etc.) |

<Callout type="info">
  **No vulnerabilities found?** That's a good sign. The scan still uploaded your SBOM to DevGuard — you'll see your dependency inventory in the UI even without active vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

### View Results in DevGuard

Open your repository in the DevGuard web UI. You'll see:

- A **vulnerability overview** with detected issues sorted by risk
- The **dependency inventory** generated from your SBOM
- **Risk distribution** across your project's components

Click on any vulnerability to see detailed information including affected versions, fix recommendations, and links to the original advisory.
