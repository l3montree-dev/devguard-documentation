# Getting Started with DevGuard 🚀

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We are currently working on the set-up flows for DevGuard - some steps might currently not work as expected.
  We would love to hear your feedback on the set-up guides. Please don't hesitate to
  Please feel free to reach out to us using our [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#devguard:matrix.org)
</Callout>

If you're new to DevGuard, this guide will help you get started quickly. We'll walk you
through the installation process, basic usage, and how to integrate DevGuard into your
development workflow.

## Installation


<Tabs items={['Docker Compose 🐳', 'Kubernetes with Helm ⎈']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    To try DevGuard with a local container setup, we provide a docker-compose-try-it.yaml. Note that it can take 
    a few moments to start up the containers, so please be patient.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      This setup is intended for testing and evaluation purposes. Before using the compose setup in a production environment,
      ensure to review the configuration files and adjust them according to your security and operational requirements.
      Especially change default passwords!
    </Callout>

    ```bash copy
    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l3montree-dev/devguard/refs/heads/main/docker-compose-try-it.yaml \
    && curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l3montree-dev/devguard/refs/heads/main/initdb.sql \
    && curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l3montree-dev/devguard/refs/heads/main/.kratos/identity.schema.json \
    && curl -L -o kratos.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l3montree-dev/devguard/refs/heads/main/.kratos/kratos.example.yml \
    && mkdir -p kratos \
    && mv kratos.yml kratos/kratos.yml \
    && mv identity.schema.json kratos/identity.schema.json \
    && docker-compose -f docker-compose-try-it.yaml up
    ```

    After the containers are up, you can access DevGuard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    Please note that in the example files no SMTP server is configured for the kratos authentication service - so you
    **will not receive any emails for account verification** or password reset. During registration you can simply skip the email verification step
    by clicking on the "Back" button.

    Another general note is that the DevGuard API service will download the
    [latest vulnerabilities database](https://github.com/l3montree-dev/devguard/pkgs/container/devguard%2Fvulndb) from our GitHub Repo and will
    periodically update it. This might take a while after the first start of the API service. So please do not wonder if not
    all vulnerabilities are available immediately after starting the containers and not all info for your dependencies are shown at first.

    ## Scan a local project and report to DevGuard

    Prerequisite: You have started DevGuard locally with the `docker-compose-try-it.yaml` file.

    To send your first scan-report, e.g. of a SCA of a sample project of your choice to DevGuard,
    follow the steps below: 

    1. Navigate to your user settings (user icon in the top right corner) and create a new personal access token with the `scan` scope.
    2. Create a new group and repository via the DevGuard UI.
    3. Open a terminal in the root directory of your project.
    4. Run the following command to scan your project and report the results to DevGuard,
      note that you need to replace the placeholders `<your-org/projects/your-group/assets/your-repo>` (just copy the slug from the URL in your browser when you are at the repo in the UI)
      and `<your-personal-access-token>` with your actual values.

    ```bash copy
    docker run --network devguard-local -v "$(PWD):/app" ghcr.io/l3montree-dev/devguard/scanner:main-latest \
    devguard-scanner sca \
        --assetName="<your-org/projects/your-group/assets/your-repo>" \
        --apiUrl="http://devguard-api:8080" \
        --token="<your-personal-access-token>"
    ```
    ## Upload a Test SBOM or SARIF Report

    Alternatively, you can upload a SBOM (details about the used software dependencies in a software project) or SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) report to DevGuard. This is useful if you have already scanned your
    project with another tool and want to import the results into DevGuard.

    You can use e.g. the [example SBOM](/example-sbom-devguard-docu.json) of this documentation (not latest) or [example SARIF Report](/example-sarif.json) to test the upload functionality.

    1. Navigate to your new repo in the DevGuard UI.
    2. For SBOM: Click on "Identify Dependency-Risks" > "I bring my own Scanner" > "Upload SBOM"
    3. For SARIF: Click on "Identify Security-Risks" > "I bring my own Scanner" > "Upload SARIF Report"
